 We are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project . We are talking about the project plan , and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on , and , yeah . So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting .
**********
 Um . So what is the goal of this project ? Is to design a new remote control . So it should be , of course , new and original , and um it should be trendy , and user friendly . That mean it's a very challenging project , and uh
 uh . So w it's we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that
 people want to buy .
 So , um
 So what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project ? So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way .
 Um .
 Yeah and everything is will be like this .
**********
 Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project . So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here . So uh . For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it .
 Okay .
**********
 Mm .
 Uh . So uh
 So I will ask you all to do the same . Just to get used to the whiteboard .
 Okay .
 So probably I would try to try to draw the animal . Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ? I I th I think I should .
 Yeah , yeah , you can draw the picture , of course .
 Yeah go ahead .
 Okay , so .
 Um .
 Okay , American , um . Um . I would use the bird .
 So I tried to sketch it out .
 I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it , but ah .
 Can you recognise it as a bird ?
 Okay it's your turn to
 Okay , okay .
 So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat .
 Oh .
 That's its head . Um I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful .
 Okay .
 I dunno if I should go with this .
 Oh it's okay .
 Thanks .
 If it is enough line . I'm sorry .
 Maybe put it up Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something .
 Yeah .
 I should get used to the tool , so . Oh just wait a little bit . C could we put it here , to make it as straight as possible ? Ah probably not .
 Okay .
 They should be remote .
 Okay , it it works like this .
 Uh , that's better .
 Okay , thanks .
 Your lapel microphone's fallen off .
 Are you left-handed ? Oh , pity .
 No .
 Okay . Should I clean ?
 Okay , I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful , so if I want to write it here , I think I can .
 Oh .
 Never mind .
 Ah , it's maybe better if you leave it .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Maybe we should just continue . Yeah , don't worry about it .
 Yeah .
 , no worry .
 No .
 Okay .
 You won't draw them , or ?
 You can draw it , if you want .
 I dunno if I can . Okay . It may be like a cow or I dunno , whatever . I'm not good very good in drawing . Okay , so this is very It's a bird , I think . I dunno what is it .
 Just try . I would like to see how it looks like .
 No , I think it's clear .
 Four .
 Okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm .
 Yeah . I'm shameful Yeah . Okay .
 Oh that's good , it's good .
 It's okay . It's in it's indeed beautiful .
 Good .
 Yeah , and strong .
 Okay .
 Bob . Have to remember it .
 Bob .
**********
 So good um So , let's talk about money . Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro . And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro .
 And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world .
 So n not only for Switzerland , but for the world .
 Uh .
 So , um .
 The We expect a production cost of maximum
 uh twelve point fifty Euro .
 Per unit , I guess . Y oh okay .
 Yeah , of course .
**********
 Um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ? So , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . Anything .
 Okay .
 Well , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . Um and and normally you only every use , you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . Um .
 Mm .
 Oh .
 So it's frustrated me in the past , th that .
 Okay , I have also some points uh . Maybe two points . Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . So something like this .
 Yeah .
 And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control . But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like .
 Yeah .
 Ah , okay . Okay .
 You know , some slider or Not just two discrete buttons for volume , but something which
 Okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay , n
 Mm-hmm .
 Is that because the of the discrete volume levels , or is that
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume .
 Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly and it can
 Yeah .
 Ah , n .
 If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream .
 Yeah , also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and
 Yeah , f It depends what what you feel about that .
 you have a heart attack .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if you have some more notes on that .
 Yeah so you can Do you have something ?
 Uh I Yeah , just a simple experience . I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune .
 Yeah , that's true .
 Yeah without obstacles and .
 Okay .
**********
 Okay . Let's continue . I have a meeting in five minutes , so maybe we should hurry . Um . So we will close uh this meeting . So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes .
