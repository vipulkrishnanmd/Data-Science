 So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the
 Okay .
 for the remote control . So .
**********
 So let's see the what
 Yeah , so can you go out to the shared folder ?
 did you prepare .
 Mm the shared folder .
 Sh share folder for th your presentation ?
 Yes .
 We have a presentation .
 Because I have here
 Uh
 So I got the participant uh
 three .
 W uh .
 Three .
 It's the final design , yeah .
 Okay just one .
 S so so I discussed with Guillaume .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 Right . And uh so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . So we come up with two versions . One with and one without L_C_D_s . Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module .
 And detachable big buttons for all people um .
 S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes . Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . You you can s here . And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function .
 So .
 Mm .
 Mm .
 Mm-hmm .
 You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . And here the the switch that control if you want
 Why you why you you put it in the the side ?
 Well I I I think uh it's the
 It's not a good place maybe .
 Yeah but
 No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . The the microphone picks up
 Yeah .
 the speeches from anywhere .
 Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ?
 Well so it's a microphone array . No it's just a single microphone , and you I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off .
 Oh it's very costly , microphone array .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Yeah yeah .
 Okay .
 And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger .
 How much does it cost this one ?
 Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars fifteen dollars , but uh well it's not it's not uh yeah , but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh voila .
 For the
 Yeah .
 Fifteen dollars ?
 Ah it's above it's above the budget .
 The cost would be le reduced .
 Yeah the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars .
 Mm .
 Hmm .
 How many b battery is there ?
 How many , excuse me ?
 Battery .
 Well uh f battery , we use uh about uh
 Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . A_A_ rechargeable batteries .
 Yeah .
 Rechargeable of course , because we have the charger .
 Yeah rechargeable batteries . We have the charger so it's no problem .
 Yeah and you just
 So one one battery ?
 On uh yeah one battery .
 Is that two or one ?
 It's kinetic reserve .
 Actually uh it's a flexible thing . You just n uh
 Now what is the whole day rating for that ?
 The excuse me ?
 Whole day's rating .
 What type of battery ?
 Oh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh if you uh like it's exist .
 Yeah yeah .
 Something like a two A_ , A_ three size batteries ? Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright . Then the next time you pick it , oh
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 At uh yeah . I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button yeah alright . This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click
 it works .
 Yeah just explain the button uh Norman .
 Mm .
 all in a single button . You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . Yeah . This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ . Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ .
 And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ?
 Yep .
 Yeah .
 I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months
 Mm .
 of function is
 getting destroyed . If you
 Uh okay this is new prototype uh .
 Yeah it's
 So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . The second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also . So basically th it's the same uh yeah . Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . Press one button uh acting as a a enter button . So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user .
 Yeah yeah .
 Uh-huh and also the switch . Okay .
 Mm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 And uh it's also cheaper to produce . We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars .
 No four dollars , it's good .
 And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , because that's a major that's a
 Oh no th actually th we'll come to that point in our
 Yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system .
 Yeah .
 Okay and if you disable speech recognition system then ?
 So
 W w I'll I'll come to that point later on .
 Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm .
 so Norman will explain to you .
 And we will we will serve the charger with this ?
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Yeah yeah of course mm .
 Th they either these with the uh the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah .
 With the remote control .
 Okay so the price of the charger included in the
 Uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh . It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but
 Thank thank you . And so mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . Well that's so
 Yeah .
 Yeah but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design .
 Yeah people are willing to pay more , but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment .
 We have we have just
 Yeah .
 The price of selling is twenty five Euros .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 And the price of
 Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features .
 production
 Or uh
 Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , so is uh modular .
 That's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more .
 Yeah yeah , for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . So
 Something like customised . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Mm hmm hmm hmm .
 Hmm okay .
 It's pretty flexible in the yeah price .
 You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control
 But
 Uh yeah yeah you should present that .
 And this is other one ?
 that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on .
 Yeah .
 H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up they come up with their modules , they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here . We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works .
 Mm hmm hmm hmm .
 Yeah
 Mm .
 Hmm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that
 Mm-hmm .
 simplicity and powerful . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . But in addition with simplicity .
 So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here . Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here oop it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? Titanium material .
 Mm-hmm .
 The titanium and so it's very uh
 Titanium .
 Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_
 Yeah that's fine .
 and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ ,
 uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , so so that's the or is it that's the reminder part . Yeah and um
 Okay .
 And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define so sorry ? And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children .
 Mm hmm hmm hmm .
 So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . Yeah . And and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think uh it's quite clear from yeah . And also like the and the fancy designs yeah . Maybe we can improve more on the design but uh this is the
 What what's
 Maybe yeah . What's the price to p to produce ?
 Well so the price to produce
 For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device .
 Uh it's about it
 With with with the charge ?
 The without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems .
 With the charger ?
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger .
 So if you uh sum up uh everything
 Yeah .
 We don't have charger .
 wi with the L_C_D_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two .
 I think we can use Excel .
 It's about so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars .
 We don't have all the options .
 Charger we don't have charger here either .
 Yeah .
 No it's
 But it's just if you want all functionalities .
 it's below the the the budget .
 Yeah .
 Excuse me ?
 It's below the bu
 the budget . We
**********
 Yeah it's a nice input but we have an
 other inputs from the l public demands . I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 I think we can just go to my presentation then .
 We can wind up .
 Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions .
 So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh
 in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold . And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative .
 Mm .
 Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . And the third one is easy to use .
 Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons .
 Mm .
 Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like .
 Spongy spongy .
 Mm mm .
 So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy .
 Mm mm .
 Okay .
 But the the problem is that uh is it robust to mishandling ?
 Um .
 We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . Spongy .
 A sponge .
 Yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias . One is fancy look , second is
 innovative , and third is easy to use .
 So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have a seven point scale ,
 Mm-hmm .
 Hmm .
 from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm .
 So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , so on this scale , if it is true ,
 Mm .
 if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . So
 So so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ?
 We can make our study on this and
 No no we have you have designed two products now , one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ?
 You .
 According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ?
 Mm .
 Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ .
 On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look how does it look ? D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ?
 Mm .
 Mm .
 Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four .
 And you both agree for that ?
 And you ?
 I think we can improve on the design . Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design . Um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help . Yeah .
 Yeah . It's it it
 Technical aspects .
 Mm-hmm .
 So I take three on with L_C_D_ ? So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ?
 Yeah a three .
 Uh four . I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so
 Four .
 Yeah .
 removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look .
 Yeah .
 And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ .
 Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five , six .
 Mm .
 Five with L_C_D_ and
 Well five also uh Norman please .
 Yeah from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative
 Uh
 of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting
 is that um the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because uh that is really innovative , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've uh
 With lot of functionalities .
 A lot of functionalities . So that is uh that is uh for both th
 So without L_C_D_ ?
 Our gi I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all well this is a biased judgement because we designed them .
 No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ?
 Yeah .
 Uh the innovation is v is very high I think .
 With L_C_D_ . And without L_C_D_ ?
 For L_C_D_ .
 Both .
 Mm for both it's the the same innovations .
 For both .
 It's the same innovation . So maybe I can put six to seven .
 Okay .
 six , let's go for six .
 Without L_C_D_ .
 Both .
 No actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness . So we can't go
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Uh no innovative yeah .
 Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ?
 Talk about
 We haven't really uh determined what are actually actually it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ?
 I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design
 No it's like this , I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . Uh then
 So let's remove it .
 Yeah ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah but
 Yeah but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen .
 But
 Yes exactly .
 This is the problem .
 No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now .
 If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n
 L_C_D_ ? Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a
 Yeah .
 But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ .
 I mean that depends upon your design , so
 Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_
 we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , we give what the customer uh wants , right .
 I mean
 Yeah .
 So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ?
 And which do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ?
 Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so I will give a six for the easy to use .
 Yeah I think sorry .
 No it's just if I I see the
 the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ .
 Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates .
 So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . Even then our product is going to be very good . Yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , it's cheaper to produce .
 Mm . S
 And uh if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so
 Yeah that's right .
 Yeah . I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , so that's why we have the parental module .
 Yep .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah yeah that's right .
 Uh we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it , but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable . User customisation is very important yeah . Yeah so
 Yeah .
 So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ?
 Six .
 Mm-hmm .
 W uh
 Or you want it to be six ?
 Um six .
 I think it's the same .
 Yeah .
 Yes as you say , with better uh yeah .
 Without L_C_D_ .
 S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ .
 And to improve the the look .
 As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , and it's going to be much simpler to use .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so
 Yeah .
 so let's go back to our laboratory and
 To improve on the design .
 So .
**********
 What a what what about the sys speech recognition ?
 Huh ?
 what about the integration of speech recognition ?
 The speech recogniser is a add-on module .
 Yeah .
 Right ?
 That's going to be an optional . If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no .
 Yeah .
 Ah so it's optional with the okay .
 It's an optional .
 It's optional yeah , since well according to this study uh people more likes more to have a spongy uh remote control than
 I think it will be I think i
 Yeah .
 I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh
 Yeah , but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it .
 Yeah . Or ma yeah . Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , so mayb better if you have all this in the same
 In the same set , yeah , and and individual buttons to make them work .
 Oh .
 The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . So we might lose the customer because of this . I don't know , what do you think uh ?
 Yeah .
 So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional .
 Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . You are Marketing Manag .
 I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ or to the number or singles who have a television . So based on that I think
 Uh
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ?
 Well it's about the same because if
 I think it inc increase .
 Well you can if you had uh something li
 I think it i increases .
 Oh no , because if you if you add uh something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but
 Hmm .
 But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options .
 Yeah yeah yeah it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module , but uh
 Mm .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 On the same P_C_B_ yeah yeah .
 Yeah .
 Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons .
 Yeah that's right . I mean you could just provide with an optional .
 So so
 Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m
 So it's something like a Microsoft product update . Updates and we sell it . We make updates and sell it .
 And and we we we we we we don't want that .
 Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? Yeah , it depends on the v production .
 Yeah .
 And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ?
 Well so
 Yeah yeah I think we are yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so
 Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and
 Mm .
 Or uh it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all .
 Mm .
 Uh well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to um ah well
 Yeah .
 What we can change is to propose the customers with skins . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better .
 Yeah , yeah that's right .
 Yeah yeah we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah that's right .
 Yeah .
 Yeah you can pl in what material would that be in uh ?
 Sponge .
 I think you need to look into the material .
 Yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing .
 Yeah yeah .
 Okay .
 So
**********
 So we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say .
 I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models .
 Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example .
 I don't know , we have to ask these question . We have to give answers so
 I suppose that you this criteria , is it ?
 Project evaluation .
 Room for creativity . This room is a bit small , but but I think it's okay for us to work with .
 I feel it's fine , we know we don't need uh I think it's okay .
 Yeah mm .
 That was good .
 This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations .
 Mm .
 Yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay . Good job good job .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 And the leadership was excellent .
 Yeah I think so . He gave you the liberty to talk as you wants .
 Fine yes uh .
 Yeah that's right . Yeah that's right .
 Uh the teamwork was very very good . I was really I am very satisfying to work with
 Very democratic .
 with you . Oh .
 Thank you .
 Thank you .
 Alright .
 Alright .
 And new ideas found . Any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting ?
 Mm .
 Come up with new product .
 I mean uh what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ?
 Less fancy .
 Mm we I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings .
 Yeah and also more well uh more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but
 Mm .
 I think it's alright . We achieved uh project goal I think .
 Yeah that is within the budget .
 De
 It's w yes , more or less .
 Mm .
 And the evaluation was
 Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple .
 Yeah that's right .
 Yeah but
**********
 Alright .
 And the next is celebration .
 So .
 So
 So uh coffee machine . Okay .
 Alright then , we finished ?
 Yeah free free coffee .
 Yeah thank you for your work and
 Yeah thank you , thank you very much .
 Thank you very much .
