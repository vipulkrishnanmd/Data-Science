 Good .
 Beep .
 Oh .
 What ?
**********
 So well uh welcome everyone . Um as you may have noticed I uh
 Yeah .
 created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder . I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting .
 Yeah .
**********
 That's new one ?
 We didn't make any uh
 Yeah .
 Uh , we should save that one .
 Oh in
 Then I'll move this one .
 Didn't we just do that ?
 Yeah , save in the folder . Save as project .
 Oh .
 Oh no , this is just one big document , so you can leave that wherever it is . And we have a evaluation left here . Okay .
 Oh , okay .
 Hmm hmm .
 Agenda .
 Hmm ?
 Well not main documents this time . Oh uh yes . I have it open myself I guess .
**********
 Um well the detailed design meeting Huh ?
 We're finally getting somewhere hopefully . Um what are we going to do ? I've opened it already . Um I'm still going to take some minutes , and if I'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ?
 Oh , sorry .
 We could .
 Aren't you ? Yes , you are . And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ? Good . And we have a correct agenda . And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those . Okay , well finance uh will be later . Now I'd like to give the word to you two .
 Yep . Yep .
 Oops .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Get up stand up . just 'Kay .
**********
 Well uh we made a prototype . We first start with the overall uh
 This is about the total remote control . We made it green .
 Just example colour , so uh there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype .
 Yeah .
 It's a fresh colour . And uh the screen light blue .
 Oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under . And the R_ and R_ logo , it just says R_ and R_ now , but uh
 Okay ?
 Any questions so far ?
 Big microphone .
 yeah , just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible .
 Yeah .
 Oh okay .
 That's the place where it's going to be , not the size .
 Uh well , it's an idea in a so .
 Yeah .
 Oh y you perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it's there and uh
 Do not forget it .
 Uh
 Mm-hmm .
 To function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course . The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button . Okay um
 Yeah , okay . Of course .
 Hmm .
 Mm . Mm , th yeah .
 Small .
 we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . Uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh I uh um
 You push the scroll button and it's claps out if there's a
 Yeah , you push the scroll button
 and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , et cetera . So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see oh , it's here , just push it in , uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible . Um
 Remote settings , et cetera .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . And you could also touch it so that it comes out , and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers .
 Yeah , that's c Yeah .
 Indeed .
 Yes .
 Okay , um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu , uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh Yes .
 In an apart uh
 Yeah .
 So a separate button for for text , okay .
 In a separate button , yeah .
 Yeah . Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah .
 A sign , yeah , just like Okay , indeed . Okay , we can uh modify that later . Okay . Would you like to make any comments about next uh
 Yeah .
 Forgot .
 Uh well , this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen . Uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward . We put ano an an extra button in . We can erase it , but It's the button where you can switch channels . just when you are one and you go to two , you can or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . Yeah , that one , yeah . It has a name . And uh uh we put that in , I thought it would be handy there . Uh this the one number or two numbers button . Below that , the page and the sound . And uh in the middle the the mute .
 Previous page , yeah , indeed .
 Oh my God .
 Uh battery indicator . It's it's a bit big . And this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop .
 It's quite large .
 Or at least it should look like it . And the options uh of teletext .
 Okay . You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh uh it's taking much part of the screen , so it's very uh when you uh when you use it , doesn't uh become irritating to see . 'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu .
 Huh .
 'Cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down , so
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah . Well this about it , I think .
 Okay . Huh .
 Yeah .
 View .
 Thank you . Looks good .
 I will put it back on the on the nice green .
 And I just missed when I was typing The R_R_ stands for ?
 That's the logo of the Yeah . It's th th right now it's only R_ R_ , but uh
 Logo , okay . Okay well
 Full screen .
 I would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course .
 Shit .
 Yeah . Sorry .
 Alright .
 'Kay .
**********
 Okay , the evaluation criteria , huh ?
 Oh full screen , yeah .
 Huh .
 Evaluation .
 'Kay , my task was this time to put up a questionnaire
 by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users . My name , my job , okay . The methods .
 My name , my job .
 Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps .
 Right .
 One means absolutely not true , seven means true .
 Yeah .
 The three important things of refa are uh from th of this year is are , is the remote control fancy enough ,
 Sorry , you used the PowerPoint
 Yeah .
 is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use .
 And then evaluation itself .
 Uh .
 What ? Bling .
 So .
 Okay . First question . Is the design fancy enough ?
 Yeah .
 Well
 Project Manager , what do you think ?
 Well it's looks fancy , especially with the green colour . And the the curves which we decided , huh ?
 Yeah .
 But does it
 Yeah .
 Only what happened to the single curve
 we spoke about last meeting ?
 Now uh the single curved idea was uh
 It uh oh it's in the background . Oh .
 Yeah , okay , you ge um
 Y you should make uh a sideways uh view .
 Yeah . The sideways view , uh that that that ma
 It will be , I guess . Oh , we can
 Ho not that pen . Not that pen .
 Oh g I would smart board . Uh can I draw here or uh
 Well it might work one time , huh .
 Suppose so .
 Think .
 Ooh .
 Ah . Oh my God , it works .
 Yeah , yeah , you can .
 So it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here , right ?
 Yeah , that's the single curve indeed .
 Yeah .
 So if you v flip it like this .
 Yep .
 Okay .
 Here's yeah .
 That's not very i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . Uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes uh in some uh space , and the batteries can be located over there , so uh
 Yeah . So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , so that it lays a bit o
 Yeah .
 Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ?
 Yeah , that's a bit of problem maybe .
 No .
 With two batteries , the whole print plate and t and top , and if you're holding it quite a lot I think
 Yeah .
 I think yeah , the battery should be in here , because it's just nothing , so if you could
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay , indeed . Yeah .
 Yeah . 'Cause otherwise I think i
 Okay , but we have to rate uh these things now ? Okay .
 Yeah , we have to rate . Is it fancy enough ? True is one , false is seven .
 So fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people .
 I think it does . I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it .
 I think so . It's pretty fancy .
 I think
 Yeah , I have to agree , all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now , it's only design .
 you get th
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 I think it does .
 Yeah .
 And the design .
 Well I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . I don't know whether older people will use it , but
 Very new thing . Well
 So
 Fancy the old people will .
 I would make it a two or something .
 A two ?
 Yeah .
 It's true , it's a one . Very fancy .
 Huh ?
 Alright , it's a one . Oh it's a one .
 No , it's a two . Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , huh ?
 Yeah , I n used I wouldn I should use that one , but it doesn't
 Yeah .
 But it's a one uh Maybe uh
 Okay , no it's two ? True is a one . Very true , is it very true or isn't that true ?
 Yeah .
 Well I'd say two on a scale
 Well they think it's very true , but uh
 It's very true , because we designed it to be very fancy , so
 Yeah , I think two .
 Yeah , but
 It's very fancy , I think . Have you ever seen a remote control like this ?
 We should perhaps
 No , okay well , that's true .
 No , okay , so so it's fancy .
 That's fancy enough .
 That not .
 Yeah .
 Then ?
 Okay , one two . That doesn't matter that much , so make it a one .
 Yeah .
 Okay . Let's give it a two .
 Is it innovative ?
 I think it is , because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone .
 Enough .
 Yeah m
 And uh uh the scroll is rubber , so s
 We have for the search function .
 It's from rubber . Yeah .
 The scroller a bit I think it's it's a one yeah .
 Eno enough to I think .
 It's a one I think .
 True .
 Also huh uh-huh the buttons , are they easy to find ? That was a big requirement of the old people .
 Yeah , because they're right on your screen .
 So you can use the b the the arrows .
 Huh .
 They're right on your screen , so I don't know where you'd search . Yeah .
 With the ones
 Are all the buttons easy to find ? Not only this buttons , all the buttons .
 Well , I think they are .
 The options are it uh little bit harder , but if you touch the options then it's uh
 Yeah .
 Take a harder look , yeah , sure .
 I think th it's
 It's easier than the regular uh remote control .
 easy t
 Yeah , I think this is easy now . I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to
 Yeah , and you use these buttons the most , huh ? So
 Yeah .
 No they're not , but they're they're they are easy to find .
 to handle .
 True .
 I would rate it a
 Yeah , they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button . So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most Yeah .
 Oh .
 Yeah , okay , that's true , that's true .
 Yeah .
 So which
 But that's that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen , you can have text .
 So which number are we going to fill in ?
 I would say yeah .
 I think it's uh it's a two , at least .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , you can make it a two .
 A two , yeah ? Two , three and what do you think ?
 Yeah .
 It's not perfect , but
 I think it's a three .
 A three ? And why is that ?
 Okay , so we have two , two , three .
 I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy .
 Yeah , but you don't have t have to use the button on the right . You can touch it . Yeah .
 You can touch it .
 It said bo both the options .
 You you can touch options .
 Yeah , okay , but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , right ? Okay , then okay , good . Then I think also two , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 You can touch options and it's comes out .
 A two , okay , because we have to
 Yep .
 A two , a two .
 The uh the um Below .
 It's the box below it , huh ?
 Uh the next question the next question . Oh my God .
 Otherwise we have two results in one question .
 It's different .
 Okay , next question .
 It's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people .
 For young people I think it's easy to use .
 Young means sixteen to forty years . And elderly from forty eight to their death .
 Yeah , I was uh Yeah .
 Yeah .
 I think it's
 I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . Yeah , but because it has the regular uh controls , li uh as you can see in the screen now , and uh
 In the entire mankind .
 Okay , you're very enthusiastic about your own design , huh ?
 Also if you're sixty years old
 you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen . So it's t I think it's really easy to use . You want these options to
 Yeah .
 Also
 As well for the for the older people ?
 Yeah , as well as your if you're fif sixty years old , you're holding one of those things in your hand
 Uh sure .
 Yeah , but uh
 Yeah , but they they don't want the uh extra options , right ? So
 No , but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people , so it it it has to be
 And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ?
 Yeah , okay , but so they could
 Uh I think it is . If they read a manual .
 Because that might Yeah . Okay , well
 If you read the manual , always .
 Perhaps that is one of the most uh
 Yeah , alright .
 M maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use .
 Because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult . You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition , then you say the question and the answer . And that's everything it does , the speech recognition .
 Uh because a lot of
 Channel one , channel four , yeah .
 Yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them .
 Yeah .
 I think it would make it uh
 Yeah , I think it does . Because all the people who can't uh
 So
 I would make it two .
 Also two ? Not a seven for this ?
 Yeah .
 Uh a two . Sure , two . Oh .
 Three ?
 I'd say three .
 I would also say three .
 Oh . You ?
 Okay , so we have three three two two or
 Two .
 Oh . Well
 So what are we going to do ? Okay , a three , I see . Uh
 Two and a half . Three ? No .
 Give me more .
 Another question .
 Remotes overwhelmed with buttons .
 No .
 No .
 No .
 No , that that's that's yeah . Tha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one .
 But um I mean , that's definitely one .
 That's definitely our uh
 Oh nee , oh seven is it ? It is . Yeah , uh the remote score .
 No ? Oh yeah .
 A false , yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah , but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results , so
 Yeah , I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed .
 It's not overwhelmed .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , indeed .
 True .
 Okay , a one , because we designed for that , huh ?
 Yep .
 Remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups .
 Yes .
 'Cause we make them in different colours , so that they uh
 Yeah .
 Yeah , is optional .
 Yeah .
 That's true .
 Yeah , and I though w we had about single colours , but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , can't you ?
 Yeah . That it that it looks like wood , like something , yeah . Uh I think you can .
 Huh .
 Also with rubber ?
 Whether it looks like wood , it isn't w it isn't wood but
 Yeah , okay .
 It it feels like rubber , but
 You can make a print on rubber , can't you ? Yeah . So that's a one then , huh ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah ?
 Well but then when you scratch it it does come off .
 That's a one ? Okay .
 Yeah , it is it is harder to
 So that's a bit
 Do you have many questions ?
 Uh I have
 to like
 Oh , okay well
 Oh we have time .
 Geez .
 Yeah , but we have We also We have to get to the money .
 We're getting paid . We're getting paid .
 The material used is spongy , that that's uh that's a one , that's m rubber .
 What ?
 What spongy .
 Yeah , yeah , it's very spongy . Oh but not it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber .
 Uh .
 Yeah , I th think it's not the most spongy thing .
 I think it's a three .
 Yeah , it's a three , because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible , because it has a L_C_D_ screen .
 Yeah .
 Uh-huh , yeah .
 Hard but
 Yeah . You can break it . Yeah .
 Remote control is hard to lose .
 Hard to lose , yeah it sh and it's easy to find .
 Y yeah , you could you could call it .
 Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it .
 Yeah , y you can lose it , but it isn't hard to lose .
 It isn't hard , no . I think I think this is a two , personally .
 Two . That it's hard to lose ? Yeah , it it is there's the it's a six , you think ?
 No .
 Isn't hard to lose .
 Yeah , so isn't hard to lose you .
 Isn't hard to lose , yeah .
 Isn't hard to lose .
 So it's a two . Yeah , you can lose it , so I don't you can make it a three I
 Yeah .
 You can't lose it .
 It does have an a built in function .
 Or if you're you're sixty years old , your demands
 Yeah , but a har
 A hard to lose is good . So it should this question should be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it .
 Nee .
 Hard to lose . Oh right .
 Yeah , this this is hard to lose .
 It is hard to lose . Yeah , so then this is it is almost true , so a two .
 This
 I think yeah , I think also .
 A two .
 A two .
 Two , yeah .
 Okay .
 Huh ?
 And most all because of the option to
 Whoa .
 Ooh .
 Yeah , it's okay . That happens above also . But maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal , but
 Oh .
 Uh .
 Yeah ? Oh , okay .
 Yep . Oh , it isn't , well okay . Remember .
 No .
 Oh well , it doesn't .
 put the cor cursor on the .
 Okay okay okay . Remote control mainly be sold to younger people .
 Click .
 True .
 I think it will , yeah .
 Yeah ? True ?
 True .
 Very true ?
 Uh yeah . Uh
 Uh well I a a two .
 No , I don't think very true because the colours .
 There .
 We have the colours . Um we have the buttons is aren't that that much .
 Materials , yeah .
 Nah , the material isn't that
 It's it's much more younger .
 Uh okay . So ma uh make it make it a two .
 So I don I think I think it's a three .
 Well I think it's it's uh a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , didn't we ?
 Yeah . I think it's a two but
 Yeah , but I uh
 Okay , okay . I think because yeah ?
 What do you think ?
 Questions ?
 A two ? I think it's two . I think it's two too , two too too .
 Two .
 Uh-huh .
 Two two two . Let's make everything a two .
 In the features ?
 Dissatisfy younger people . Um
 Younger people . It has
 Well perhaps not .
 What did
 Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing .
 Yeah . Well that it doesn't .
 Well , n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that , but it's for a remote control I think it i it would satisfy those needs . Yeah , the speech possibility , the colours .
 Yeah bu but
 I think they like the speech .
 You could call to your uh yeah , and the screen , yeah .
 L_C_D_ screen and scroll .
 Scroll options , yeah .
 I I think they'll be quite met with their expectations .
 Yeah , but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features or something .
 Right , that that that those are features .
 No .
 It has relatively few features , with
 It's three features , basically , the L_C_D_ touch screen is feature .
 Yeah .
 The microphone is a feature .
 No , aren't the features the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , and that you can change the options of the remote , uh uh something like that . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , okay .
 Ours had other features with
 I think yeah , and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings .
 The easy volume up button .
 Those are features .
 Remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume . Turn uh turn up the volume .
 Yeah yeah . So I've chos I shou I think it's it's it's a one .
 Enough features ?
 Personally , yeah . I think once you've 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll
 thing extra .
 Yeah .
 Okay , you think one , what do you think ?
 I think two or three .
 You . three , yeah . I'd say three , so two it is then or
 Two .
 Yeah . Yeah uh a two a two . Just another two . We like two .
 Make it make it a two .
 One two three .
 Or make it uh a fucking two . You can see the remote control is R_ and R_ .
 Right .
 Yeah , there's R_ and R_ in front . Uh it's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , but it has R_ and R_ .
 Uh .
 Yeah . Yep .
 Has oh yeah , do did have nah y you have the black one . And we'll probably make also a yellow one .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but not R_ and R_ yellow I think .
 Yeah . Yeah , maybe maybe two . Well m th but the logo is on on the front , so a two , yeah , that's
 Maybe two .
 Okay , true , yeah .
 One d on i it's the colours and the
 X_ marks spot . And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use .
 I think it is , but I don't know what you think .
 I think it's easier to use than a regular remote control , because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . Entirely explained .
 Yeah , tha that's so true .
 Mm-hmm .
 Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , uh
 And you can navigate easier , because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal T_V_ uh remote .
 Yeah , you can navigate .
 Uh .
 I think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it . No , I'm not not convinc . Let's go th for I think it would be a t yeah , two . Now lower .
 You're not satisfied , okay . Let's start over again then .
 Yeah . Let's make a different remote . Well
 Menu .
 A two ? We only have twos .
 A two .
 Oh , well that's that's pretty good , huh ?
 Oh yeah , I think so . Yeah .
 Uh just twos . One three and a few ones .
 So okay , we have one three , a one , that that have to got up .
 And three .
 Two threes .
 Two two two two two . So two , yeah . The average is a two . That is quite good
 We m mostly have twos , so it's pretty good .
 Yeah .
 The average .
 Yeah . I think so too .
 in my opinion .
 Yeah , I think so .
 That
 We can be happy .
 Ooh .
 Save .
 Ooh .
 Yeah . What is it ? It's like a bug or something . A fly , yeah .
 It's a fly .
 Oh m
 A f butterfly .
 Top .
 Yeah .
 That's it .
 Okay .
**********
 That was your evaluation uh show , okay , so we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results . Okay , good . Um let's see oh , it isn't asked to save but it did already
 Yes .
 Sure .
 No , it's two . The average is two .
 It's good . Yeah .
 Yeah . Exactly .
 Yeah , I uh uh I uh saved it .
 And this
 Everything okay .
**********
 Well , the next part uh might be a little bit
 difficult to do
 in a group , but I am willing to try it .
 Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that .
 Yeah .
 Redesign . No .
 And um I'm not sure if I put it in the project folder . look on that . Um and we're going to calculate the production costs , and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty ,
 Yeah .
 we're good , and if they're not we're going to uh re-design , but we have to do that uh very very quick I think , yes . Um I don't know if I
 Yeah .
 So we're going to erase features or something .
 Do you have the cost or uh
 put the Excel sheet in the
 Let's hope . We're going to be here at eight o'clock .
 n not in the
 f fifty five Euros .
 folder . I think it's
 I think it's still in my own documents folder .
 We're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock .
 No .
 I doubt it . Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet .
 Oh shit .
 Yeah mm yeah , maybe .
 So
 No , it was in my uh my information , so uh
 The microphone . Yeah ? maybe you're going scrap scrap it .
 Yeah . It i It wasn't too much .
 Yeah .
 As well as the L_C_D_ screen . Whoa .
 Okay , well this is it . Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take minutes , and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions .
 Well , if it doesn't work
 I want to fill it in , but uh
 No prob .
 Ah .
 But you should uh direct
 Count it ? Li like write it be
 Well we have to count some things and we have to think about some things . But you have to fill in this column , huh ? No , uh count uh number of functions , because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots , so or different different screens , so
 Count it . You got Excel to count .
 The number of
 Oh okay . Well I dra uh Danny , Danny , I'll do that , because I draw the uh
 Ah , okay , cool . Huh ? Yeah ? Oh , yea yeah , you design it . Um
 We've got a battery , one or t two batteries , or not ? nee one battery , with two small batteries .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but it's it's more about the energy source , huh ? Do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ?
 Yeah . I would do a battery we do . Right ? A battery . One battery , right ?
 Solar cell . No it took a battery ?
 We'll wait .
 No , no solar cell , no no no no .
 Yeah .
 No hand dynamo . Hand
 Yeah .
 Electronics , simple chip advanced chip , right ?
 We have
 No , we have sample speaker . But b al but we also have sample speaker , do
 On advanced chip .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Yeah , so this one and this one .
 Uh we ha we have um single what ? Are we ? Oh yay .
 Oh , we already on nine .
 We have double curved .
 The single .
 Single nee single curved . Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional . But it isn't three dimensional , it isn't curved in a l
 Single .
 This one is
 Oh the the it's not going to work uh people . We have rubber .
 This one is curved like this , right . It's curved like this .
 I'll just fill it in .
 No no no , single curved is like this . Uh that's the only curve you made , not th uh curved like that . That's uh
 Um rubber indeed ?
 Yeah , bu what
 Oh , but we have curves like it and it . There are two curves , right ? Oh , okay I understand , I understand . Rubber .
 Thirteen ?
 Huh ?
 With a scroll wheel , right ? Is he integrated ? No , eh ?
 Yeah .
 I don't know .
 Push button . No , we don't have push button .
 Yeah , we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s
 Oh yeah , right , we want it to it's not it's not no . Yep . Fifteen , oh , too bad .
 L_C_D_ display .
 Not going to work ? Okay .
 Okay um
 Oh but with special colour we have . A special form , right ?
 But now button supplements . We don't got the button supplements .
 Oh , we don't have any buttons , so Yeah , we need to uh
 Eighteen and a half , damn . We have to lower it with six points .
 Damn .
 No , uh we have fifteen and oh , right .
 Okay .
 Twelve and half .
 We could lose the curve .
 Nah .
 We could use
 Yeah , I would lose the curve .
 We could lose the scroll wheel . You could make it just a regular scroll wheel .
 But you can't push it , so you have to tap .
 Yeah , if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button .
 Yeah , alright . So normal scroll wheel ?
 Yeah , I think that will be
 our best bet .
 Normal scroll wheel .
 And I think we should lose the curve .
 I think we should scrap the sample speaker . It's four pri it four units .
 Lose
 Yeah , but if you would i it is a new feature , it it's something special .
 Okay , so we don't exactly need the single We don't need a curve . 'S possible to lose curve .
 But w d wha
 No , the curve doesn't really
 Curved then it will be square .
 No , then it will won't uh stand up from the table . Then it would just
 Okay . Yeah , that's meant with scr uh with s curve . The curve is uh in a dimension . If you make it a flat one , s n it's no curve , you got no curves . Yeah , okay .
 Was that does that mean to it , single curve ?
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 So
 We would lose this one ?
 Yeah , but tha that that only is one .
 Yeah , we could s yeah , a bit .
 No , two .
 No , one .
 Sixteen point three .
 Oh , okay , indeed .
 So we don't Yeah , we also have to
 So we still
 Is it possible to make
 Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ?
 No , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen .
 No ? Ma y you just can't do that , or uh
 No .
 And what did you change ? You changed the uh scroll wheel and
 We changed th
 Yeah , and the single curved to uncurved .
 Single curved . Flat .
 Oh , but it's just one
 Yeah , so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think
 point , so maybe you should should uh
 No .
 Scrap sample speaker ? That that's uh
 Yeah , you should you should drop the speech recognition .
 The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points .
 Yeah , but it's t
 Yes , four points .
 Yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , it is something special .
 And then you can keep the curve .
 Or can't you ?
 Yeah , uh becau uh when you lose the
 Yeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? F You have to we have to scrap four points .
 I don't know . Yeah , that's difficult .
 Yeah .
 Or make it on a hand dynamo , but I don't think that will work .
 Yeah .
 Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ?
 No , that's no . Make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ?
 Uh .
 We could make it titanium instead of rubber .
 You don't make a remote control of Ah .
 Yeah , it it i Yeah , it also uh it also takes one point less .
 Yeah , mm-hmm .
 Yeah , but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , yes ?
 Oh . Oh can I ask something ? What is special colour ?
 Yeah .
 Is that the wood uh wood uh this , we have to have that one too ?
 I think it is .
 It isn't .
 What ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but it's only a half . But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker .
 Yeah . Sample speaker .
 To knock the sample speaker , yeah . And sample sensor .
 Th then we still have too much
 Yeah , okay , three . Point three .
 if we use the uh
 But m yeah , course , but What we'll have . Let's make it thirteen or fourteen .
 Yeah , we we scrap that one ?
 Huh ?
 Point twelve .
 See , a po three . We need point three .
 That's a scroll wheel .
 Uh it's a colour . Don't make it wood .
 A colour .
 Yeah , but a wood we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood .
 Make it uh
 Yeah , but it's it's special colour , is it
 Yeah , special colours , fruity colours .
 a all kind of colours ? It's also green or uh
 Is it also no that that's just normal colour fruit colours . Normal colours , yellow
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . You don't say here's green rubber .
 Yeah .
 They don't sell green rubber plants . Alright .
 Yeah , but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half .
 Yeah , you can , you should you have to lose
 But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap uh
 No , it is the scroll wheel , I guess .
 No no no .
 s advanced chip .
 No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ? Five ? Then we have two .
 If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen
 S touch .
 A push , yeah .
 then it's possible to make . And then you can and then you can add to the colours .
 Then we can make add two colours on it . Yeah , two colours it .
 Special c Okay , if you lose uh if you lose the
 Switch colours .
 It was such a great idea .
 You lose this one , you got eleven point five and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example .
 They can add two colours .
 But the colours . Um how ma uh the colours like l she told ,
 is that all the colours we add or
 How d uh uh how many colours ? Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p
 What do you mean ?
 Yeah , but we we we are we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium .
 Yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour .
 Ah okay .
 Oh . But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , 'cause you have to add it .
 I suppose .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but the rubbers alls original black .
 Yeah , so you always lose the special colour . You co you could make it always black , like normal remote .
 Yeah b
 Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow uh red , and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now .
 Nee we we also want to make ano another colour .
 Oh right , yeah . Yeah , we should u Yeah . We have to make this like four or five or something . That's what it means .
 Yeah , but m
 Yeah , because we have more colours than only black .
 Yeah , but isn't it per remote that you pay ?
 Yeah .
 I then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special
 Oh right , yeah . Is it per remote ? Yeah .
 Half ?
 I think you pay half per remote . So each remote with a special colour .
 Yeah , that's right , and you one colour per remote . So then it is one .
 Yeah , indeed , yeah . You don't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote .
 Yeah , okay okay , true .
 True , true .
 No .
 I hope .
 We have two points spare . Nee one point .
 So the battery , we have um advanced chip on print .
 One .
 So it would be curved , single curve .
 Because of thing Yeah , well you can at least make it curved again .
 Or not ?
 Hmm .
 So y you just can't make a nice remote .
 Yeah , single curve .
 Because that was very important , huh ?
 It's too bad for the speaker .
 So it's curved , it's still that so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker .
 Should we change that tha that that's a one if not , or not ? Could you copy it ? And make it uh
 Mm yep .
 We dropped the scroll wheel .
 And the rest is the same , huh ?
 Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped .
 Am I right ? Yes .
 The entire uh
 Uh . Huh .
 Yep .
 Perhaps you can then copy page or so .
 Ooh .
 No . Oh you you made the entire could you
 Okay .
 Undo , undo . Undo .
 Oh not Well .
 So , 'kay . Twenty minutes ?
 Would you ?
 By the Perhaps you can save this one , and then copy or something . Add it copy page .
 Select all .
 No , but you c yeah .
 Alright , something went wrong .
 Tap .
 Okay , but this this new remote we can afford .
 It doesn't work . Let's forget .
 It should've work .
 Okay , so you had this list at start ? Alright . When did you receive this list ? Ah okay .
 Hmm ? No , I hadn't . I just received it .
 Yeah . Oh ignore that .
 They don't work so hard at the finance department .
 Ah okay . I suppose this is a
 Well , so
 Okay , so we lose the scroll wheel , the s
 Too bad .
 Yeah . The microphone .
 Yeah , and that's it .
 Yeah . A and we changed something , I guess , or not ? We
 And the microphone .
 Oh no .
 Yep .
 Okay .
 Twelve Euro fifty .
 Um and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ?
 Yeah , I tried to copy that one , but it didn't work .
 It didn't work .
 So we could fix it like tha that it's like this .
 Hmm . Strange .
 You could select it all , but then you can't erase .
 Strange .
 Oh , you can arrange
 You can only re erase ? Oh .
 Erase . When you saw th li uh Earlier when we selected it , w I couldn't erase anything .
 Uh , no .
 Hmm , can't you then just say copy ?
 Bling .
 New page .
 Paste . Yes .
 Ah .
 Select none .
 just tap somewhere .
 Just tap somewhere .
 just up somewhere b uh besides it , right .
 Okay , and now you can erase .
 Yeah .
 I don't think I can , but uh we can try .
 Uh , we already try .
 Well it should be possible .
 Oh , yeah , no , ha-ha .
 Oh no .
 Well you can draw over it with white uh pen . Oh .
 No ?
 Yeah , we tried it earlier . It's very much work .
 Yeah .
 Sorry .
**********
 Well but that's also useful for the evaluation , because I think uh we have a prototype now which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh
 Evaluation drops .
 design . Doodle . And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time .
 And erase the mic .
 Yeah , goodbye mic .
 All I need is no mic .
 Let's see , we can save this now .
 Oh , I already erased half of the line .
 Bon chance
 And move back to here .
 Too bad , oh .
 Like this ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Still looks nice .
 And then all green . Okay , well thank you .
 Oh , that's erase .
 Looks like a iPod .
 Oh , no .
 No , add
 Hey , but you can erase that .
 Yeah , that's a bit weird . Oh , now I'm line .
 Yeah .
 Uh-oh .
 S Difference between lines and text and the pen .
 Yeah .
 Oh . All I need is mic .
 Right .
 And you can't erase this ? Hmm , strange . Okay , well uh just leave it at this and quickly save . Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation . We just did our project evaluation . Um well , I think I can sit for that since it's almost my final slide . Um
 No , it's weird .
 Station page .
 Huh , looks fucking boring now .
**********
 what did you think about uh the process ? How satisfied are we ?
 Deadlines were sometimes very short .
 Yeah . Bu but stressful . You think , no , my presentation isn't ready .
 Mm-hmm .
 But And stressful .
 Yeah .
 I think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together . Now we worked through each other , something he said yeah , and you had information I also had , so some some things I had in my presentation , they already told , so
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 And you could ask things .
 Yeah , you had information I didn't have and then uh
 Oh right .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what , huh ? And uh
 Yeah .
 So yeah , that I don't think that is the best way to work at for such project .
 Yeah .
 No .
 So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work .
 Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate .
 Yeah , but but why not work here together , for example ? Why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah , you could
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Well , probably to simulate the whole working uh process , huh , th you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks .
 I think so too .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but then you can work together too when
 Yeah m yeah , like she told . Then you can work together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something , but now we're completely separated from each other . I don't think that was the best way , but
 Huh , oh right .
 No .
 A chat would also be uh
 But the technology was uh fantastic .
 Yeah , the technology's okay .
 Well , I I don't really like the board , it doesn't really work great . Sometimes I think .
 Work now ?
 Yeah okay , but I don I do I think becau that's because
 Perhaps it is e
 It does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't uh
 Yeah , perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there . So you can draw uh see it over th on the screen . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , like the f like a plotters or something , yeah . Yep yep yep yep yep .
 Yeah .
 So you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful or
 But
 It's useful , but not m
 Well it is useful , but it doesn't really work all the time . Th the pen doesn't
 Yeah , it is useful , but
 No .
 Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below .
 The line is a bit off .
 Yeah , so it's maybe a bit unnatural also .
 Yep .
 Alright .
 Yeah , you can point to where you want the line to be .
 But
 The project uh because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh have , you didn't have time to uh to make a very uh
 qualitati qualitative uh presentation .
 Yeah .
 So you used uh this
 uh the different PowerPoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the
 Oh .
 That wasn't me . Uh so um the means , we discussed the smart board , and what about uh this digital pen ?
 Wasn't me .
 Yeah .
 I
 I didn't use it at all .
 I I used it , it it was you can use it , it's quite handy I think .
 Yeah , well I use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer , huh ?
 But I didn't I uh
 Yeah , I used it to y to Yeah , it did work pretty well .
 I used it too , but oh well .
 I didn't use .
 Yeah .
 I don't think why you would want to use it actually , but it it does work .
 Yeah , because it shou
 No yeah .
 To make some designs , it is very easy .
 Yeah .
 It is it is yeah , it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , and then you can show it to everybody .
 Yeah .
 But to write it th yeah .
 Yeah . It's b bi little bit too big to write .
 It doesn't really write normally . It's a bit
 Yeah , it's too big , it's too fat .
 Yeah . Fat document , those .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay , um
 and what about the teamwork ?
 Team work was okay .
 I think it was great , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , well I think so too . we
 Only thing that we worked through , past each other . With some things that was only problem , but
 Right .
 Yeah , but that was it was our assignment , huh ?
 Yeah , but it was because we didn't uh Yeah .
 Yeah yeah yeah , but furthermore better .
 Okay , and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point , the leadership .
 That's yeah , no prob . Ah .
 I thought it was good , but uh Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah well , okay .
 Not too much , not too too too too .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 And creativity ? Well , when we look at this I'd say we have been creative , huh ? But
 Well .
 Yeah , or the room for it was the idea to be creative , so
 There was room for
 Yeah .
 You got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out .
 Mm-hmm .
 And you get get stuff from the from the computer , but
 Yeah .
 The information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late or
 Little bit uh lo yeah . Too late it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema yeah .
 Yeah .
 You just sit there for ten minutes . Yeah , where is that email ?
 Yeah .
 I played I think seven times Solitaire something .
 Oh did you ? Is it on there ? Is it on there ? I didn't find the didn't look but uh I didn't look , but
 You did ? Well , I didn't have time for that .
 Wha
 At some times I Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment , and then
 Oh right , it is there .
 Was searching and searching .
 No , I I never got that . I always
 I got like one email after ten minutes or something .
 N yeah .
 I even got spam . Or something like that .
 That's what we said .
 So does this I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think , sometimes , in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to do .
 And it not a lot uh
 No , the first one . I didn't know uh
 No , w I didn't know
 Yeah , like I with with the remote and I never new we have t we had to uh yeah made a made a rec a remote control .
 Make a r yeah .
 nee .
 And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here , so I went , right . Yeah . Just looking at the screen and uh
 Yeah , so
 Yeah .
 No stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page .
 And I was working and working and work Okay , well um but after all we can say uh we are satisfied , but it it could've been uh better . When we get uh when we have we would have gotten uh more information .
 No .
 So , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm . Faster .
 Yeah , an
 Yeah , more information about the costs .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , that will be handy .
 First of all I didn't think uh that we were able to make an L_C_D_ screen uh first point , but uh it was possible uh uh , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , it only costs four units . Uh yeah .
 Yea uh so tha actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen , when you look at that . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , that was a bit mean to put it in the end . And uh what were the other points to to improve this whole process ?
 Yeah .
 Uh , I dunno .
 Um
 Yeah . Nothing .
 Think that's about it .
 Hmm . Heavier um less heavy laptops . Yeah .
 I think we got it already .
 Yeah , they're pretty heavy .
 Yeah .
 Uh . Faster laptop .
 Uh . They were they were just fine .
 But that's not really uh
 And furthermore the the the network was okay . Everything you loaded was also
 Yeah .
 Uh .
 Yeah , everything worked .
 av available there .
 Right .
 And so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work , is what you say . Okay .
 So
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah , but that
 It's now half past four half past three , so
 Yeah , but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone .
 Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay .
 Then it pops up pop up screen came . Five minutes in the meeting . No .
 Mm-hm . Mm .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
**********
 Okay , so more time during the individual work phases . Um okay well uh I just got my warning for the last five minutes , so I'll move on to I guess my last slide , yes , which is the closing . Well uh , we managed , but we did it very quickly . I don't know if that's the best way to when it isn't is it when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say , okay , this is it , but we had to do it , huh , because we have to have a design , and that is within the budget . And we evaluated . Maybe we should re-evaluate uh the product , but we did that before , and we also evaluated the project . And I think uh everybody's uh very happy . At least I am , with the results , so uh celebration , well , for the three of you , because uh I have to write the final report now . But uh well , thank you very much for your co-operation , and I had a very nice day so far . Okay .
 Huh .
 You did ? Well
 Oh , right . Well
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Champagne .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , sure .
 No prob .
 Oh thank you .
 Mm-hmm .
 Do we get another email ?
 Bling . You're fired .
 Um
 I think you do .
 I I think we have to fill in a questionnaire again , but
 Yeah I have t I think we also have to go to our own rooms again , but um well I at least . But maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this , so I can try to include it in the final report .
 We do ?
 Mm .
 Yeah .
**********
 Uh th that that one ?
 You cannot you can save it .
 Yeah , maybe . wants to , but at least this one . I know , we should remove this , but it won't h
 You can just Yeah , but it's it isn't a picture or , well , is it ?
 You s uh file save as the J_ PEG J_ PEG .
 Okay . And uh please put it in the project folder then , huh .
 Can you find it as a J_ PEG ?
 No .
 No , isn't possible . But you can make a screen shot , I think .
 Okay , well I uh
 No .
 No .
**********
 I hereby officially close the meeting and uh I hope to see you uh soon .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 In uh
 In about five minutes .
 Uh oh , export .

**********
 How big do you want the images ?
 How big ? Uh
 Yeah .
 not too big . Whatever you think is good .
 This one ?
 Six hundred . No , I yeah .
 No that uh is one thousand twenty four .
 I think eight hundred six hundred is better .
 This one ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 If it browse .
 Nah , name .
 Um
 Desktop .
 Well it isn't on the desktop .
 Hey .
 Mm ?
 I do not know .
