 Nick Broer , User Interface Designer . I'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view .
 Excellent . Okay .
 My name is Xavier Juergens , I'm the Industrial Designer , and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today . First one is uh what happens inside the apparatus , second is what is uh the apparatus made of , and the third is what should it look like .
 Hmm .
 What should it look like ? Okay .
 Hmm .
 Oh , let's kick it off . Oh , there we go . So , our new project is about we need design a remote control for television set , so , which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I took this off our corporate website . It's I think well it sums up what we need to do .
 We're inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design . That's why our product will always fit in your home . So apparently we need to um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market . So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want . So
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 So we put the fashion in electronics . So that's what we need to go for . Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha uh three phase of design . First step will be the functional design . And that's basically what we're gonna do . Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , so we can share information about So I'm gonna keep this short , since we had a technical problem . So skip through this .
 Yeah .
**********
 Uh . Okay . Every meeting we everybody can present their uh their views and everything , so to help with these , you have we have the SMARTboards here . We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it's actually it's very easy . Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen .
 Like you see here , I'll just take the take here . That's it , you just put it on the board . You see a pen here . You go here , just like using a pen . You can just draw whatever you want .
 It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want .
 And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger .
 So it should be really easy . This is to take the just take a new slide and back again . We're just gonna keep using this board all the time , so I think it will be it's very clear for everyone , I suppose . So I'll take this out .
 Okay .
 Okay . We'll use that later . Anyway . Yeah , just just just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like I put my presentation now . I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever .
 So next , been here . Well , gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot . So basic idea is
 we have a blank sheet . Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal .
 I think the creative genius should go first .
 The creative genius ? Thank you very much .
 So , draw us your favourite animal .
 Well , I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing , so I'm not really good at drawing animals , but uh the animal which I Oh .
 Draw us a technical animal .
 Yeah , it's still erasing .
 Pen .
 Uh format .
 Else my animal will be like king-size . I pretty much like a dolphin , because of its uh its freedom basically . Let's see .
 A head .
 actually worked with this . It's like uh it's a very
 Uh high-tech . Bit low-responsive though . Prefer pen and paper .
 So that's what we don't want . We want a high-responsive product . So
 It looks more like nuclear bomb .
 Very nice dolphin .
 It doesn't look like a nuclear bomb . This thing isn't doing what I'm
 What I want .
 So
 Let's go easy on it .
 Yeah , well it does look like a nuclear bomb .
 I'll just finish up real soon , because I'm
 So it doesn't really look like a dolphin , but then again , this is all new for me .
 Anyway , it should It It's supposed to be a dolphin , you like the freedom that it that it represents .
 Uh-huh .
 Like the ocean , like swimming . Do that in my spare time , so that's basically an
 What do you like ? Okay . Well , our Marketing Expert . Show us an animal .
 Now we can forget this ever happened .
 Um an animal . I like the elephant .
 Pick a pick a pick a clean sheet . Oh . Take a clean sheet first .
 What ?
 Yeah . Um
 Just press next . That's it .
 Oh yeah . Oh , a blank . Okay , next . Free , I like the elephant . It's big , it's strong , so uh uh Oh , it's a little bit
 It's not really that responsive , no .
 You have to hold it , right ?
 Mm .
 Hmm .
 It's a beautiful animal .
 Oh , you have to p press it pretty hard .
 With a smile on it , it's very important .
 It's a cute elephant .
 Yeah .
 And uh not to forget its tail .
 Oh .
 It's a nice beard .
 Yeah , it's okay .
 And you was making comments on my dolphin .
 Yes .
 I will beat the dolphin . No .
 Okay , so it's just a bee .
 Yeah .
 So I suggest you make us the elephant in the market . The big and strong player in the market . This would be good . Okay , excellent . On to the next one .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Uh yeah .
 Okay , you should press next .
 Yeah .
 Press next . Yeah , it's up there .
 Okay .
 That's it .
 Okay , well the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger .
 You picked a hard one , didn't you ?
 Experience with the tiger .
 My drawing skills are really bad , so .
 What ? They are
 They are really bad , my drawing skills .
 Okay uh-huh .
 Sure looks smooth .
 Oh .
 I'm not sure how the legs should go , but
 Uh these are stripes .
 Got it .
 I've picked this animal because it's very fast . It is uh it knows exactly what it wants . Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources .
 What does it want ?
 Uh well , basically uh it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well-thought way . Uh it knows exactly what it wants . It never kills an animal uh just for the killing , so it's very efficient . And it tries to do everything as fast as possible . And it always goes for uh security , in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything , security , speed and efficiency is important . And I think uh those things we can use .
 Okay .
 Mm .
 I agree .
 Okay .
 Yay , I'm supposed to draw the animal next .
 I introduce to the world the amazing
 ant .
 Uh hard worker .
 Great team-workers .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Do everything to Uh really small , but together they're really strong . So I'm gonna give it a smiley face .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Oh .
 Not sure where the p . Just put 'em here . Whatever .
 Think it need shoes . So
 I'm just too lazy to draw it all black , so
 That's the coolest ant ever .
 You've done this before , haven't you ?
 I love to draw ants . It's my hobby . Anyway Nah . Just I think it's very representative what we drew , I guess . Like you take just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us .
 Yeah .
 Just Yeah . You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct . Anyway . another beep to stop the meeting . See . Warning . Finish meeting now .
 Uh put this down .
**********
 Examples . Well I guess we have a little little time extra , but Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work . So what do you guys think about The first idea is just very short . I'll start with you . What are y What are your first ideas for the new product ? What
 Well , I basically had a question . Do uh Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ? Is it just the T_V_ or do we want to in
 Uh
 The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control .
 Just for T_V_ remote control . Okay . Well , I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all . Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with . No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it revolutionary changes , yes .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I guess so .
 But
 Yeah .
 Okay , so very intuitive design , I guess .
 Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . So that was something I wanted to add , and perhaps some usability aspect . T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ?
 Yeah , we want
 I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . So I think I mean , really disabled people , yeah , might be a problem , but I think it's a little take it into consideration . Um yeah . I think we really need to cut the meeting short . You have anything you wanna share quickly ?
 Hmm . Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light . That's it speaks for itself , but some uh Yeah .
 Uh .
 Yeah .
 It should be light , okay . Um , let's see , where did I Let's skip that . Oh , this is it . Sorry , I skipped this sheet . What do we This Quick What we're going to Selling price , twenty five Euros . That's for you . The production price , twelve and a half Euros , approximately . Just go go for that . We'll reach the uh reach that profit .
 Yeah .
 Selling price .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Okay , well that's not that much to work with .
 international .
 No , it's not much to work on . I'm sorry , I skipped it . Anyways , that's Yeah , this is it . Do you have anything you you came up with yet ? About uh marketing transfer , whatever ?
 Um about what ? Marketing ?
 Marketing I'm not sure what you what you came up with yet . You have anything to share ? Or else we'll cut the meeting just cut the meeting short since we're supposed to stop .
