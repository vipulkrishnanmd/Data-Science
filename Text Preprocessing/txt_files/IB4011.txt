 It's just that I need uh some some white paper .
 Are you gonna take the minutes ?
 Uh yes .
 Yep . Um
 Good .
 So hello everybody . So uh you everybody had the a agenda for today , you received it or
 Hello .
 Hello .
 Um , hello ?
 Um I don't , do you have an extra copy ? Thanks .
 Yep .
 So the goal for today is to decide for a movie to project at the end of the month , so for this month of of April , and also discuss the content for an adver advertising posters and um I I will present you three des different design , we'll discuss it . So first we have to decide for um a movie .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay .
 So I think we all prepared documents .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yes , I did .
 So I propose that we start with uh presentation Agnes uh sent .
 Sure .
**********
 Okay , so the previous movies that we've done this year were Lawrence of Arabia , Apop Apocalypse Now and Amadeus , which were all historical , serious , dramatic and somewhat actiony movies . So for this month I propose doing something different , preferably something set in the present , um something maybe dramatic but slightly less serious . So what I'd propose is actually a thriller or a mystery . And while these days people are so jaded by general movies that they tend not to be surprised by the endings in mysteries , some movies in the nineties did actually have twists that people came out saying , never saw that coming , I didn't know that that was gonna happen .
 Mm .
 And so what I'm gonna do is present you two of those movies , and before anyone says that , well , if you know th how the movie ends , you're not gonna wanna see it again , that's not necessarily the case , because a lot of people like to re-watch movies um to see where the clues were , what they missed , things they didn't pay attention to the first time around . Um so if you can go to the next slide . What I'd propose is either The Usual Suspects or The Sixth Sense .
 Good . Um so those would be my two choices .
 Have you seen it ?
 Yep .
 Okay .
 So what was you criteria for selecting this movie or
 Let it's a sort of different style from the other movies we've seen , and they have a twist , so it's not your general movie where you just kind of sit through it and go , oh okay , get up and leave . It's at least out of those two movies I came out thinking , oh cool , okay .
 But then it's only at the at the end that it it becomes a good movie .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , but
 I mean that's a good thing , right ?
 Only because of the of the end .
 Okay .
 I I've heard some people in the in the theatre saying , oh now we have to see it again .
 Yes .
 Yeah .
 Ah .
 Which is a good marketing ploy , if you think about it .
 But then if you asked them five minutes ago okay .
 If we show it twice .
 Okay . So is Bruce Willis the child psychologist ? Ah . Great .
 Yeah , Bruce Willis is and the kid is really good , who plays the the main character .
 .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah . It's the guy who then played in uh Artificial Intelligence or something like this , mm-hmm .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Great .
 Same guy .
 Um The Usual Suspects is slightly less mainstream . Um is has a fairly large cast , notably Kevin Spacey , Gabriel Byrne , um and it was directed by Bryan Singer , it's one of his earlier movies I think . It was written by Quist Christopher McQuarrie .
 Um and according to Rolling Stone it's the freshest , funniest and scariest crime thril thriller to come along since Pulp Fiction . Uh The Sixth Sense on the other hand is a more commercial movie with its famous line , I see dead people . Um it was written and directed by M_ Night uh Shyamalan and stars Bruce Willis , Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette , and it's about a little boy who sees dead people and i he sees a child psychologist to try to get him to understand why he sees the dead people , what it means .
 Ah .
 Hmm .
 And actually the psychologist is dead .
 Now that you've given away the twist , yes . Um
 No , but we're the clubbers , but
 Agnes , uh I was just wondering , uh I see uh I have here Denis's table , and when they say that it's the freshest whatever since Pulp Fiction , well that's probably not a very long time , because Pulp Fiction is ninety four and Usual Suspects is ninety five . Okay . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 Mm .
 Send your complaints to Rolling Stone . So on the next couple of slides I'll just go through some of um more detailed stuff that we might need for administrative purposes . Um the length for The Usual Suspects um is a hundred and five minutes . Uh as you can s well , as Andrei already said , it's n nineteen ninety five . It has an R_ rating , which means that at least in the in North America it was not recommended for people under eighteen , 'cause it's fairly violent , but not so violent as other movies . Um plot outline uh five villains in New York are rounded up by the police in an unconventional manner that worries them . After release they get together for a spot of revenge , but someone else is controlling events . And the big mystery of the movie is who's controlling the events .
 Um it got an eight point seven out of ten user rating on the Internet Movie Database , it's sixteenth in the top two hundred and fifty movies of all time , forth in Denis's list of the top movies of the nineteen nineties , which I think was also taken from I_M_D_B_ . Um it won several Academy Awards , including best supporting actor and best writing , um best film for the British equivalent of the Academy Awards , it was nominated for a Cesar for best foreign film . So it got a fair bit of recognition despite not being
 Yep .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 um a very mainstream , high budget movie , or maybe because it wasn't a mainstream , high budget movie .
 So wha what will be your argument for projecting this movie ?
 I don't think a lot of people have seen it , in fact , other than
 I haven't see it .
 you haven't seen it , you haven't seen it , you've seen it .
 I haven't seen it .
 Yep .
 And don't think a lot of people have seen it , it's not a very very well known movie . What ?
 It's very well known . Yeah .
 Is it ?
 it's a
 Really ?
 See ?
 I think , yeah . It's one of the most well known thriller .
 .
 Really ?
 That surprises me , I always got the impression that it was
 Oh .
 It's it's hard to tell . So that's your impression . Yeah . That's mine , but uh
 Yeah .
 That's my impression , yeah . But it's it's rated four fourth in uh in the list and one hundred one hundred thousand
 Yeah . Well , it's a good movie .
 Yeah . How many people voted for it , yeah ? That's true .
 seen it .
 Yeah .
 One hundred thousand . One hundred and two . For for voted for it , yeah .
 Voted for it .
 Voted for it , and I think only two other mov uh no , f three other movies uh have uh have more votes .
 More votes ? Yeah , it's it seems to be quite popular .
 Yeah .
 So but I think the main thing is it's got a good twist at the end and
 Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
 it's it's an interesting movie to watch .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay .
 Um so if you go to the next slide . More or less the same thing for The Sixth Sense . It's slightly newer , nineteen ninety nine , more or less the same amount of time . It has a lower rating , 'cause it's less violent , but it depends what audience we are gonna have at the showings .
 Yeah .
 Isn't violent at all in fact , or it's more like scary or
 It has it's scary and I think it has some sort of slight violence , but .
 Uh-huh .
 But the kid is seeing dead people , I mean is uh it's quite uh
 Yeah , but they're not violently dead .
 No , but it's quite uh morbid you can say that ? Yeah , morbid .
 Scary or yeah , mm-hmm . Creepy or
 It's it's morbid and it's creepy , but it's not violent as in people being sliced in half or anything like that . Um um it's nineteenth in the top movies of the nineties , hundred first in the top two hundred fifty , it was nominated for a lot of awards , it didn't win
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 as many . Might have won more sort of minor awards , but at least the Academy Awards , it was nominated for five of them , um but didn't win . Nevertheless still a good movie , still a good twist at the end , which Denis already gave away .
 Mm-hmm .
 They don't remember .
 Mm-hmm .
**********
 Okay , so uh I think , Mirek , you prepared a presentation also . We can have a look .
 Yeah .
 So my presentation is not that detailed , I just uh put there seven uh highly uh ranked movies , and we can just try to g uh go very quickly through all of them , just to re remind you them , and then we can perhaps consider another p uh potential candidates .
 Sorry , it's control L_
 Mm .
 Okay , so the movies that I have selected as as very good uh good ranked movies uh are uh uh are on the screen so uh Shaw The Shawshank Redemption , Schindler's List , Usual Suspects , Pulp Fiction , Goodfellas , Silence of the Lambs and American Beauty .
 Um so what will be your favou your preferred one on in this list ?
 And I think that's the last
 Yeah .
 If would like to go for something what is really serious I would definitely uh go for Schindler's List , and if not uh then
 Hmm .
 I would like to see this uh Shawshank Redemption , because it receive i yeah , it it none of us seen this movie unfortunately , but uh as you can see from the from your from your table , there is a plenty of votes . It's actually I think it's a movie with highest number of the votes , yeah , it is .
 The first one , yeah . Probably yeah , you received so yeah .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Yeah , that's true .
 And it's uh Tim Robbins and uh who is the
 the guy behi Morgan Freeman . Yeah . Yeah , great actors .
 Morgan Freeman .
 Morgan Freeman , yeah .
 Yeah , but didn't I mean I see this name of the the director on the slide , but I don't really know him . Frank Darabont ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Darabont .
 Me neither , me neither .
 Mm yeah .
 Never heard of this guy .
 Yeah , but really I would like to highlight that it's a it's a movie with highest number of the votes and the highest ranking at the same time .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yep . Okay . Yep , it tells something . Okay , it's just a do we want to have to display the most popular movie or or we're
 Mm-hmm .
 So .
 Yeah , I'm not sure . Yeah .
 Well let's go through the other suggestions .
 And actually I don't think it's it's it's that popular in Europe at least , because I really you see , none of us have seen it , so .
 Yeah .
 That's right , yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , maybe . But it's true , yeah , we shouldn't stick to only very highly rated movies on this table . Though it's a very useful table , but um okay , do you want me to yeah .
 Okay , Andrei , yeah , can can you comment your
 So yeah , uh I wrote some notes on um on Saving Private Ryan , which is my candidate . If you can display them it's perfect . Uh do you all have a copy of them ? I have some paper copies . Uh you're welcome . So actually given that more or less our theme since the beginning of the year was um history , drama , action , and given also that , well , we decided to to present this month a movie from the the nineties , um I thought that among these movies , who look quite popular , uh Saving Private Ryan would be a very good candidate . Um
 Yeah .
 I do .
 Um yeah , I w thank you .
 Yeah , yeah .
 actually it's a movie I've seen . Have you seen it before ? Okay , so you've all seen it , so maybe everyone has seen it , I'm not very sure . Um but I think it's a very novel treatment of of war , it's uh it's no longer the b glorification of uh , whatever , combat and victory , but the plot is quite different , it's about saving one person who has a special special value in the in the movie um if only because his brothers actually were all killed , so uh the government believes that they should save at least one person from the family , and saving means actually removing from the the front , if you if re if you remember the plot .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 Yeah .
 So in fact this guy , the Private Ryan is not at all the main actor , the the main a well , the main character is uh played by Tom Hanks and it's actually you can see his picture on the second page of my my notes uh Captain John Miller . So he is sent with this rather strange mission , which is not a combat mission , but they uh they want just to to get this guy back , which is in fact this guy is I think behind enemy lines or something like this . So it happens in in Europe , just after the the Normandy landing , and it's very very striking the way they they filmed all the the combat scenes and uh it's it's very dramatic , it's uh it's not , you know , like in the movies from the fifties or the sixties where people just fall and die anonymously , but here they well , you see everything and you see how many people die on that day . It's actually
 Mm-hmm .
 And you e
 Up close .
 And you enjoyed that , the fact the you see clo I
 Well it's very strange , you could s ask this for any sad movie , did you enjoy it . Well I didn't really enjoy to see bad things , but uh I think it was satisfying to see that , well , how dramatic things are . Yeah . Exactly , yeah . I it's very moving , I it's true , it's not very it's not very , well , happy . I don't know how it would compare with Apocalypse Now , if it's darker or maybe
 To realise how it wa how it was exactly .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 It's very different , I don't think you can compare them .
 Yeah , it's very different , yeah .
 Yeah . So yeah , so I think this would continue a bit our our theme . So the the movie is ranked quite high , if I if I refer back to your table it's number uh , what actually , um fourteen . Quite a lot of votes , so um also one of the the mainstream movies . Um on the second page uh of my notes I well I quoted some uh well some facts about the movie that I found interesting , we we could use them for either a poster or uh or a presentation . Um especially I enjoyed the story about the the colour saturation . It's true that the movie is not really black and white , uh but uh the colours are grey-ish , dark-ish , it it prov it makes a very moving effect .
 Mm-hmm .
 To make it like uh an historical movie or
 Yeah , I think also to show the um yeah , I think it's the reference to history and also this dark yeah the mood and uh things are actually well most of the things are quite grey , you know , the uniforms , weapons , things and things like that .
 Also sets the mood a little bit .
 Yeah , mm .
 Darker and
 Yeah , but you'd get a different impression if you had bright blue sky and bright sunshine behind it .
 Mm-hmm .
 Exactly .
 But if I read your first point in the in this uh trivias ,
 I am just surprised because it says that all the principle actors uh underwent several days of uh cruel army training except for the Man Matt Damon , and the reason was that they wan uh that the that the director wanted that uh the other actors would resent him . Why this was uh wanted actually ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Well I think Matt Damon is the guy who must be saved , if I remember well , and in fact the die
 Yeah , he's private Ryan .
 Yeah .
 And they didn't like it , they didn't like the mission ?
 Well yeah , the people didn't understand why they should save one person .
 Well
 They're being sent to the front behind enemy lines to retrieve one soldier only because all of his other brothers died .
 Oh .
 So and they are quite resentful , because they I mean they feel they should fight , they shouldn't just go there and uh just get someone and get back . And in fact some of them d get killed for this guy . Actually most of them , yeah , I think so .
 Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
 Yeah , and it okay .
 Most of them get killed , don't they ? Yeah .
 Yes . Most of them . So there is actually several people dying because of one single single soldier , mm-hmm .
 So
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , yeah . It's a very I think some people compare it with uh , whatever , Christian message or I dunno , but um I think it's quite quite universal and it's uh I think it's a modern , very modern
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 What kind of message ? Sorry , I'm not getting your
 Well this uh value of one individual , it looks like a Christian message , you know , the value of one is compared to others I I don't know I th I think I heard this at that point , but maybe I'm just wrong . So yeah , I I think it would make a coherent choice . It's probably a bit long and we might want something that is lighter and funnier , but uh if we want to keep this this idea of history and conflict and also to show some some kind of modern treatment of it , it it would make for a good choice . But if you see in my notes at the bottom of the first page I put some other candidate movies .
 Okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh La Vita e Bella is an Italian one , but it's also about history and it happens at t the same period as Schindler's List . And I also quoted Pulp Fiction and Silence of the Lambs , um a bit more remote from the themes , but quite well known movies and enjoyable I would say . So do you have any questions about this , or should we just move to the next candidate maybe ?
 Hmm .
 Yep . Or or we have you have
 Okay .
 I have no comments , no no , it's
 Mm-mm .
 Okay . So actually I don't know if uh
 y any of you have uh read the document I prepared on The Big Lebowski .
 Mm-hmm .
 It's just below the table , so since we all refer to the table
 It's below the table , yeah . I wanted
 Yeah , but I really appreciate your table , because I found this table really useful . It's a very nice summary .
 Yeah . Yeah , yeah , I wanted to say that uh it's quite open , there are many choices possible . But then my proposal is The Big Lebowski from um the two brothers uh Coen , Coen brothers . And it's a actually Joel Co Coen who uh directed the movie . Um
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 the plot is quite hard to to make , but maybe you you read it al already you understood something from the plot or
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 I tried to .
 Yeah . No , I think the summary is i is quite good , and especially I think it uh well mm when you read it you just want to go to see the movie . I think it looks funny for me . I haven't seen the movie , but uh the summary looks funny .
 .
 I am ?
 Yeah , it's it's it's a bit like the f in my opinion like um American Beauty , because it's it's a funny movie but uh it critiques a lot the American society . And the the the hero , the the Dude , the mm Big Lebowksi , it's actually his name , is a a kind of non-hero , but he's representative of the of uh a normal uh L_A_ L_A_ guy . And uh he has a friend comi veter veteran from Vietnam and uh another friend who is never speaking . And they all are together in a bowling club where they meet and they discuss about uh everything . They seems to have no job , I not know , we never seen i them working . Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 So doing nothing , just uh take it easy in the life , yeah .
 And actually he's uh taking part to a kind of um uh
 Mm-hmm .
 uh s some some killers come to his apartment uh because they think he's someone else , and uh the whole story is about uh he wants to to to get some money out of this story , and he's going to see the other Lebowski to ask him money , because he he because the killers actually uh damage some stuff in his apartment .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Actually , who are the two characters on the the p the poster , on the on the image that
 It's uh Jeff Bridges and uh John Goodman . John Goodman , you have probably seen him in in a series ?
 Uh-huh .
 Mm-hmm .
 And w and which one is the Big Lebowski on the picture ?
 On the right , the guy on the right , Jeff Bridges .
 Okay , so the guy with the glasses .
 Mm-hmm .
 And the one on the left is his friend ?
 Yeah . He's the one coming uh from from Vietnam . He's kind of uh
 Or is that the other Lebowski ?
 The Vietnam guy .
 Oh , okay .
 Aha , yeah .
 he is still equipped for for war . Okay so uh
 Hmm .
 But this movie is is supposed to happen in uh what time , I mean it's uh
 It's f a movie from the nineties actually , yep .
 Which ca
 From the nineties ? And he's still uh still uh prepared from or or still as he he would come from the Vietnam .
 Yep , yeah , yeah , that's a problem . I'm going to actually I want to show you some posters I prepared for this movie , so we actually can discuss at the same time the poster design .
 Okay . There i
 Well , sort of .
 Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
 Oh .
 So on the left you see the main characters of the movie , so the the hero at the top left . Then it's the guy coming back from Vietnam . Afterward it's uh uh a guy who John Turturro , they are competing with him on a bowling uh contest ,
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 and um Julianne Moore and the last one is Buscemi or something like that . Buscemi ? He's never speaking in the movie . Each time he's trying to speak , the other one are are stopping him .
 Buscemi , yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Really ?
 Oh .
 So it's qu
 And this one is supposed to be the second Lebowski ?
 Or who
 No , he's not on the on the picture , the second Lebowski .
 Okay , okay .
 So uh my proposition was to add um the title of course , some information abo about the pricing on the right
 Yeah , you cannot read it very well because
 Uh yeah , but when it will be printed it will be okay , I think .
 But actually I'm I'm little bit missing th some information about our movie club , I think uh there should be some more information .
 Ah , you mean
 Okay , so I prepared a second one
 where th th th there's there is some information . At the bottom we can see that um , do you know Mondre Montreux English Movie Club ? Uh I said that people can contact us to to get to the committee and select movies .
 Mm .
 Yeah I like this , mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm , yeah .
 Uh-huh . Yeah , the text on this one is very good .
 So um .
 I think it looks too much like a C_D_ cover , though .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay .
 Oh because it's square .
 I like the layout of the first one and the content of this one .
 Uh-huh .
 So perhaps we can somehow combine them .
 But there is a th there is a third one .
 Um actually I I prefer it because it's more colourful also .
 It looks like two different posters though .
 Yeah , I don't like the black one . The f the first poster is I think much uh much too dark .
 I think there is too many colours , too many colours . Nowadays , you know , if you see some advertisements on the s yeah , but nowadays if you see some advertisement on the on the street , this is typical typical uh poster I wouldn't wouldn't look at .
 No , that's nice .
 But it's it can catch the eyes actually but um
 Yeah .
 It's hard to read .
 Yeah .
 But then the problem I preferred the first one , because I think it's important to have the plot of movie , e especially for uh a movie people don't n never heard about it . But uh I don't know .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm . Yeah , maybe two or three sentences , because I guess they won't stop in front of the poster .
 Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
 Okay .
 The paragraph I think was a little bit long .
 Okay , so what do you propose , what should I do for these posters ? In terms of content .
 Yep .
 So layout of the first one
 I would and content of the second one .
 and colours of the third one .
 Okay , I'll try to do something , but first anyway we have to select a movie . So I'll put all the information and you want me to put the at the bottom , all the information about the committee and the the Montreux Club , okay .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Mm-hmm .
 Exactly .
 Yeah , like what you have there .
 Okay .
 And then maybe replace the paragraph that you had on the first poster with either shorter sort of descriptions , not even of the whole plot , but just descriptions of the movie or 'cause I think that paragraph is too long , people don't r generally just stand there and then read the whole thing .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Okay , so just to conti to finish with The Big Lebowski , it's um I think those two images are pretty representative , so the on the first on on the top you see the hero with a a cowboy that i introduces the movie , and on the bottom it's uh he is he keeps dreaming in th in this movie , because uh uh the killer's um uh put it d put it or he is drinking too much also , so each time he's uh drinking he's having some dreams , very very weird , but interesting .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
 Oh okay .
 So the woman on the second picture , that's Julianne Moore or oh .
 Yep . Yeah , yeah .
 Actually , she wants him to she wants to make kids and she's using the Big Lebowski to have kids with him , but he doesn't know . So maybe he's making strange uh
 Ah .
 Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
 Interesting . So it's not really violent or I mean the movie is quite for general audiences . Okay .
 Okay .
 Yeah , yeah , it's very very sweet and it's like a it's like a dream actually .
 okay .
 How is it actually r ranked , because I cannot see it here in your table .
 Huh .
 It's um no , it is on in the table actually . It's um it's coming at the end . Forty eight . But quite a lot of people have seen it actually .
 I somehow can't find it .
 It's here , forty eight .
 Ah , forty eight .
 Yeah , fifty thousand , mm-mm .
 Well , at least voted for it .
 Yeah .
 I hope more people have seen it .
 Voted , yeah .
 Yeah , but generally you vote when you have seen the movie , no ?
 Mm .
 Uh so perhaps we can go to the to the f to the first movie . Uh The Shawshank Redempt uh Redemption um actually I didn't see that movie , so is there someone else who have seen this movie ?
 Uh me neither .
 No .
 Okay .
 I've heard a lot of really good things about it , but
 I thi
 I have s I have seen it , but I don't remember it . Which is not good .
 So uh I was told that in French it was called uh Les Evadees .
 mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay , the plot outline says that the life of Andy uh Dufresne Duf okay , of Andy , changes when he uh he's uh convicted and jailed for the murder of his wife , and the user comment says it's simply amazing , the best uh film of the nineties . So that's uh what it says , okay , we can't tell much more , because basically none of us have seen it .
 .
 Yeah .
 Should we should we believe this ?
 But the rating is very good then .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm , yeah .
 Okay , th so the third one is The Usual Suspects . So I think I I wouldn't uh I don't want to comment it again , so we can just skip that , because it was this this is the one already commented by Agnes . So let's go to the to the other one .
 So the second one is a Schindler's list , it's more serious movie , it's from the St uh Steven Spielberg and it's about the Second War uh Sec Second World War . Uh the plot outline is that the Oskar Schindler uh uses Jews to uh start a factory in Poland during the war , and he witnesses the uh horrors uh endured by the Jews and starts to save them . User comment says , a film for all to see and learn , and I think it's really something what is very serious uh theme and uh yeah .
 So that's a Schindler's List , um we can perhaps do you have some comments ? I I have seen it . I think it's really good movie , it's uh it's quite long actually , I can't uh here I didn't put the the minutes , but I think it's it's at least about three hours .
 Yeah , I think it's about three hours long , something like that .
 And it's a heavy movie , I it's emotional , it's
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 It you know if it's to uh if it received some award ?
 No , I don't know , I don't know , unfortunately .
 Or
 Probably no ? Yeah , I think also but uh
 I think it did .
 Either for director if not for best picture .
 Yeah , maybe even best picture , yeah . Mm-hmm .
 But I would expect it . I would expect it . Okay , so if you can go to the
 Yeah yeah .
 But yeah , indeed , it's maybe too sad and too , yeah , too poignant for
 Well , it's a true story also , uh so .
 It's a true story , yeah . It's it's yeah , I would say that the user comment says everything , a film to see and to learn .
 Yeah .
 Well
 And to remember maybe , or
 And to remember as well , yeah .
 Mm .
 Pulp Fiction . I would say that's that's like a classical movies of of nineties , uh it's uh directed by Quentin Tarantino , it's a it's a crime and drama , it's a a there i there are several s several stories that are just mixed up during the during the movie , and uh
 Yeah .
 yeah , it's a real classical movie , I would say almost nowadays . So
 So who has seen it ? Agnes , you've seen it ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , I've seen it .
 Yeah , I've seen it too . Yeah it's it's very good and it's a bit violent , but it's also quite funny I think .
 I've seen it .
 Yeah .
 So all of us .
 Sure , sure , you can see it several times , because I mean the first time you cannot catch all the details , and then i when you see it second times and third times it's
 It's a
 And it's
 Mm-hmm .
 it's the comeback from of uh John Travolta , no ? So uh
 Yeah , yeah , that was his comeback movie , yeah .
 It's big comeback , yeah , big comeback of John Travolta , yes . I would say good comeback .
 Big comeback , yeah .
 Bruce Willis is there also .
 Yes . Who is there ? Huh .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 the boxer .
 Um
 Sorry ?
 Pardon ?
 Yeah , yeah , yeah , Bruce Willis is there as a boxer , yeah .
 Yeah , as the boxer .
 And what's the name of the girl on the poster .
 Um
 Um
 It's Uma Thurman , yeah .
 Uh Uma Thurman .
 Uma Thurman , okay .
 Yes .
 Okay , so that's Pulp Fiction , definitely should be considered uh .
 Yep .
 So on the list I I brought on the docu on my document , the two movies , Pulp Fiction and Usual Su Suspect are just swapped . Pulp Fiction is actually coming before The Usual Suspect .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Wow , that's interesting .
 How .
 Uh maybe 'cause I_M_D_B_ is updated daily , so if it happens that people had voted for it
 That may be .
 Yeah , because yeah because I have I have uh I have th this review on on Wednesday .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , Tuesday , it's quite surprising though , but uh , okay .
 Okay . It's
 Yeah , it's strange , with so many votes that they can p shift . I mean statistically speaking it's strange .
 Yeah .
 Goodfellas , I haven't see that movie . The plot outline says that the Henry Hill and the his friends uh work their way uh their way up through the mob uh hierarchy , and uh the user comment says , it's a simply a masterpiece , so and if you go to the to the to the votes , there is quite a lot of people who has vote for the Goodfellas , sixty six thousand . Okay , it's
 Mm-hmm .
 It's modern day average , so it's perhaps not a bad movie . I dunno , I haven't see that .
 Wow .
 Mm .
 Actually I have seen it , now I realise , yeah , yeah . No , because I thought it was like another movie , but it's it's this movie actually .
 Have you ?
 You have seen it ?
 Yeah ?
 Mm-hmm .
 But it is this movie .
 But it was that movie ? Okay .
 uh-huh . And how i was it called , Mafia ?
 Ah okay .
 Uh Les in French .
 I think it that one , but it's very violent .
 Okay .
 Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm .
 Very .
 It doesn't say it here , but uh it's probably rated R_ .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I wouldn't be surprised .
 So it talks about the nineteen twen twenties or something like o of twenties ?
 No , it's later than that , isn't it ?
 It speak about uh a guy who is not Italian , who is uh going up in the hierarchy of mafia .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay .
 So .
 Okay , so .
 Not really in favour of this , but
 The mob , so the mob is the mafia actually ? Okay .
 Mob is mafia , mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Silence of the Lambs , that's a godfather of all thrillers , I would say . Fully in line with the user comments . Uh basically it's a it's a thriller , horror and crime all together . The plot outline says that the uh Clarice Starling , the young F_B_I_ agent is assigned to help a f to help find a mi uh missing woman and save her from the ps psychopathic killer with the help of another killer . This another killer is actually in a jail and it's uh Anthony Hopkins , and he really plays it a very good , I would say . I'm not sure whether he received some a awards for that , but it's really it's
 Ah .
 I don't know , but it was a good performance , creepy .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yes , very good performance , very good performance .
 And Jodie Foster is very good as well .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , and we can see her actually on the picture on the on the projector .
 Mm-hmm .
 She was pretty young , no ? For .
 .
 Yeah , I think , yeah , when yeah , I saw this movie some time ago and yeah , she looked quite young I thought .
 I think so , yeah .
 W w from whe when is the movie ?
 When did it come out ?
 Um
 uh ninety one uh ninety one uh .
 Ninety one , .
 Ninety one , yeah .
 Yeah .
 So nowadays she's already fourteen years older . Yeah .
 As are we all .
 Yep .
 And I saw this movie when I was like uh twelve or thirteen and it was really really uh bad experience . So I can't remember all the details of that movie , but I would like to see it again .
 Yeah , me too .
 I don't think I've seen it since then .
 Mm-hmm .
 I recently I saw the the uh Hannibal , that the seco the sec uh it was a third third part actually , it was called Hannibal I guess .
 Ah .
 No , on the seco uh second one .
 It was second one , yeah .
 Yeah .
 So that's why
 But not that good , no ?
 It wasn't that good , but I think it was almost more disgusting in a way
 It was really disgusting , yeah .
 There were some scenes in it where normally I don't get queasy watching movies , but that was just too much .
 Yeah .
 Okay , what's your opinion ? You have seen it ?
 Okay . Oh yeah , I've seen it , yeah . Yeah , it's a good movie , I um I don't know , maybe too well known , but since it's fifteen years old maybe people would li
 It might be a little bit too violent
 Yeah .
 for I dunno .
 Violent and and uh scary as well . Mm . Psychopathic , I mean it's uh
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay . And last choice .
 And the last choice that um I think it's it's not a bad movie , it's uh American Beauty . Uh
 That's a good movie .
 Yep , that's a good one .
 it's basically about the about the people in America , each of them is uh I would say psychotic in his uh his own way , but uh normally they appear to be uh s normal people , as as we can see them ev every day . Uh so and it's really it's uh the user comments say it's a deep , wonderful , penetrating uh film , extraordinary uh irony uh in a psychological drama about American life , and I can fully agree with this user comment . Uh
 And Kevin Spacey ? It's no , Kevin Spacey , he received something , no ?
 Yeah , it's Kevin Spacey .
 Oh again ?
 Quite possibly , yeah .
 He's actually uh quitting his job at the beginning , but he's uh simulating a fight with his boss in order to to to pursue pursue to
 Mm-hmm .
 He's simulati I I I've seen this movie , but I
 I see .
 S mm-hmm mm-hmm .
 Yeah , I think . Yeah , to sue him afterward . And then
 Yeah , yeah , yeah .
 Mm-hmm . But then he fell in love with the the with the with the friend of uh his daughter , if I remember well . That's really
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Ah , that's the girl who is represented on the the picture ?
 Maybe .
 Yep .
 Theoretically , yeah .
 You recognise her belly ?
 No uh there is this rose , because the she's he's imagining her taking baths with ro roses all around and uh he's uh yeah .
 Yeah .
 Uh
 Yeah , yeah , that's true , yeah .
 Oh so you recognise the rose .
 Exactly . Okay .
 Uh-huh .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
**********
 Okay , so uh I think we should decide for a movie now .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 So
 maybe each of us can s can select two movies or
 Yeah , let's nominate first .
 Let's nominate , okay .
 Okay .
 And then we vote we choose from the list .
 So I will take basically two extremes , I will take Schindler's List and I will take uh The Big Lebowski .
 One of the one of them is really just funny and from the nineties , uh I mean the story is from the nineties , while the second one is about the Second War and is uh serious .
 Mm-hmm .
 Well I'll nominate the one I proposed , Saving Private Ryan , so history , war , drem drama . And I haven't seen it , but I would like to see it and I think American Beauty .
 Mm-hmm .
 If you if you think that our series okay , it's not about America , but uh still Apocalypse well , yeah . It's about countries . So , Agnes , Denis ?
 Um I'd go for Sixth Sense , just because it's different from all the other ones and
 maybe Shawshank Redemption , just because we haven't seen it .
 Mm-hmm .
 So Denis , are you happy with our choices or would you like to add something ?
 Um no , actually I'm happy with the choices , because I really I would really push uh American Beauty , because I think it's uh it's an easy movie to watch and and still there are a lot of things to think afterward .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 And it's representative of the nineties , I think .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 So what if we voted , say , like for first and second choice and then we count ? You can give two points to one and one point to another one ? Would you like this strange way to vote ?
 Okay . Yeah .
 Okay , that's
 Okay , start , Andrei . No
 Um okay so uh
 I don't want to finish I think I'm going to
 Oh yeah , um well it's uh well if I nominated two and I was the only one , I'll give two points to Saving Private Ryan and one to American Beauty .
 Okay , um
 You don't want to finish , Denis . Then you'd better hurry .
 Yeah , but then each of us will will uh but then each of us will vote for uh our nominees , so I would propose to to to vote for s sun uh to to give the points to the to the movies that were not nominated by you .
 No .
 Okay .
 Okay . That makes the vote more complicated . Um okay , so I'll give um uh b um
 Yeah , maybe it makes more sense , yeah .
 Okay .
 So then it's it's more complicated but yeah , okay , let's
 Mm-hmm , okay .
 okay , two to The Sixth Sense and one to The Big Lebowski .
 Sixth Sense .
 Okay , me I put two to American Beauty
 and uh one to Saving Private Ryan .
 Okay , um
 'Kay .
 I note that you didn't nominate a film , so you are sort of freer than us . Agnes ? Okay , oh .
 So I'll
 Seconds .
 No , Big Lebowski , I nominate .
 I'll give two to American Beauty and
 mm
 one to The Big Lebowski .
 okay , and I wi I will give one to The Big Lebowski and two to The uh uh Shawshank Redemption .
 Okay , so it's pretty clear .
 So now try to sum it up .
 American Beauty four , Big Lebowski three . So you have to redo the posters , uh ?
 American Beauty .
 So do we have something ?
 American Beauty . Uh three .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , that's the only thing that's worrying me , but it should be okay . Yeah , yeah .
 Mm .
 Well you can keep the format , I mean th you didn't have that many graphics in the first one .
 So you select you wanted actually me to select the this design ? That takes a bit more time , but if you c if all of you can send me one image , I can make something on the left . Select one image from the movie and uh
 Mm-hmm .
 You mean the first poster , yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 But I would say these images are very nice and they are really representative perhaps .
 Maybe you can leave those .
 Yes , but of the wrong movie . That's the real twist .
 Mm-hmm .
 With a different title ? Okay . No but I'll make something .
 I'm Yeah , sure , sorry . Sorry .
 Oh leave Julianne Moore .
 I was sleepi sleeping for a while .
 Julianne Moore actually uh
 She's playing in the no ? In American Beauty ?
 No , she's not .
 No , it's who is it ? Annette Bening , who's the m the main character , the well , the main female character , the mother .
 Ah okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay uh we s
 Okay , I'm looking forward to seeing it , I haven't see it , so
 We still have to decide for next meeting and we're all set .
 When do you want these images by ?
 Just quickly .
 Uh by uh Monday , next Monday .
 Day after tomorrow ?
 Um so we have to select the movie for May .
 It should be from this period , because nineties
 I think we can meet at the same period .
 would be finished .
 Two thousands .
 Mm . Two thousand .
 So uh we'll try a movie from the two thousands .
 Mm-hmm .
 And we can meet at the beginning of May . So I think Monday is second ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 No .
 No , Monday is third already .
 Third isn't it ?
 .
 Mm whatever .
 Monday May third ?
 Whatever .
 First Monday of May .
 Okay .
 First Monday of May , yeah , so it's after the projection , and we will see what are the reactions of the people and so it makes sense that we are yes , yes , yes .
 Yep .
 Yeah , how many people we got and uh
 We can ask people casually , sort of what genre of movie they want , or
 Mm-hmm .
 And perhaps we will have some new members .
 But then in June , what are we going to do in June , because we cannot make movies from ten two thousand
 Um
 Start again .
 Maybe some kind of movies that spans across periods . I think there is a Godard with a lot of um quotations from other movies or well let's see when we
 Or go back to the fifties .
 Yeah .
 yeah , maybe .
 Let's cross the bridge when we get to it .
 Okay . Thank you .
 Okay .
 Thanks , see you April ni twenty ninth , American Beauty .
 So what's the movie again ?
 American Beauty .
 Okay . Thank you .
 American Beauty , finally .
 Okay .
