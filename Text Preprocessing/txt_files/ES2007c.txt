 Oh right okay .
 I cover myself up .
 I feel like Madonna with one of these on . I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on .
 .
 I've always wanted one of these , I really have . Where do you buy 'em from ?
 They're .
 Right . Hello everybody . Back again for another wonderful meeting . Is uh everyone ready ? Okay , we c we can hold on for a minute .
 Hello .
 .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Almost .
 Oh my gosh .
 I figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in .
 That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive .
 Mm 'kay .
**********
 Are you ready ?
 Okay , right , well , I take it that you are all ready now . Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , and who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on .
 Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um
 now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .
 Mm-hmm .
 Hmm .
 Do you have any preference uh of order ?
 Um I'd like to um hear o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . I want what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and
 Batteries .
 I think she is still finishing her .
 No no no no , it's fine I'm just preparing .
 It's just that yeah , let's let's hear from you first .
 Hmm .
 Okay .
**********
 Where is that thing ? Oh sorry , couldn't see .
 Okay , it's uh
 It's here .
 Would that work ?
 Get yourself in position .
 Ah .
**********
 Okay , so that's me again .
 Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v yeah , yeah . It wouldn't be very fancy . You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work . Or you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but
 I don't think any of us remember the fifties .
 Is it like a crank thing or something .
 Mm .
 Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power .
 Yeah .
 Do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ?
 Mm .
 I dunno actually .
 Does anybody know ?
 Uh I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know .
 I dunno .
 Um .
 Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , but I don't know if it's worth the cost . So we've got to discuss that .
 Okay .
 Mm .
 Mm .
 Okay , jolly good .
 For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what I mean , so
 What's a double curved one ?
 You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing .
 So
 Okay .
 Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex ,
 uh rubber , wood , or titanium . And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could uh
 So that might be an idea of using the rubber , but then it should , you know yeah .
 Yeah .
 Let's have a squeezable remote .
 Yeah . And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , I dunno
 when a T_V_ programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . Yeah , I like that idea .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 So rubber would be
 Okay .
 I think rubber's
 Rubber , we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea ? You think you can market that ?
 But after my after my fashion thing , I think you'll realise that rubber is more
 Uh s so if d okay .
 Ooh , we like rubber , ooh .
 People .
 And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display .
 Um scroll buttons , as well .
 Uh-huh .
 So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . So it's a constraint .
 Well , we're gonna go with I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so
 Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons .
 If that makes sense .
 push buttons instead of the wheel ?
 Yeah . .
 If it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , it doesn't matter if it's double I mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , I mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ?
 rubble double double .
 No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing ,
 I'll have a Big Mac , please .
 then you have the case is uh , whether it's flat or curved . And that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . And I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go I dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons .
 Okay .
 So , either
 I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case .
 Let's have rubber push buttons , hey .
 Okay . Go rubber . Go rubber the whole way .
 Let's go crazy . And then , do I have a last slide ? Yes , I do . Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . Um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive .
 Yeah .
 Simple , yeah .
 Chip on print . It's a bit .
 Okay , uh what I'm not understanding here
 Mm .
 is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ?
 .
 Yeah .
 The infra-red .
 Yeah .
 Right . Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ?
 Y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ?
 Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . It's less expensive mm
 so it sounds
 Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too .
 So , why would we not go for that ? If it's something that's inside the the unit . I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . Um we wanna go for an i i all so long as it works ,
 Fo
 It doesn't , yeah , yeah , yeah .
 Totally .
 Yeah .
 So let's not go for the
 Yeah , yeah . I agree .
 you know . So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print .
 So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons .
 Yeah .
 S yeah , push buttons .
 What about the just developed uh sample sensor ?
 I think push-buttons is
 What about what ?
 G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing .
 Well
 Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ?
 Mm , I dunno .
 Be cool . Channel two .
 It'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it , I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and
 Yeah .
 S
 Th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh , 'cause uh
 Yeah . It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product .
 The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um
 That when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever . But , I mean , it's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns comes on , but it's not that . It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response . So , yeah , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ? Yeah , if you're really lonely , it is it's
 Yeah .
 Hm .
 Oh , it just gives an answer .
 Oh , then then
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 I thought I thought it was when they said
 Just if you are really lonely , maybe .
 I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like , channel five , and it will change . Like you talk to it . Can I have channel five ? Oh , then forget about it . Oh right okay .
 Channel five . And then it switches on .
 No , tha that w that w that would be more promising . It it's just a remote that talks to you . Uh . I mean to certain cues .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the
 'Kay .
 Yeah , I'm fine with the basic battery .
 Basic battery . It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work .
 Mm .
 Hmm .
 Cheaper option . Are you happy with that ? Okay . So we'll go for the battery .
 Mm . Yeah .
 Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ?
 We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ?
 Yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved .
 The the
 So it will look like something like this .
 Double ?
 The double whopper , please .
 Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , and that's fine ?
 Yep , but we're going for the simple buttons .
 So rubber rubber keys , yeah .
 Yeah . And it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ .
 P
 Yeah .
 .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 So that's another marketing point that we can use .
 Well the rubber push-buttons .
 Don't you have to move your
 But anything is gonna have buttons .
 Mm .
 Even if it's a jog wheel , it's still repetitive .
 I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a
 You
 You see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . It's not actually what you are doing .
 That they don't .
 .
 Mm .
 But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific
 Mm . Yeah , the rubber's good .
 Yeah . We're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , so they can sit there and go like
 Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful .
 And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah .
 Oh yeah , I guess T_V_ can be stressful , yeah , if you're watching sports .
 Alright , that's me done .
**********
 Alright .
 Okay , Gabriel . Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface .
 Alright .
**********
 Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about .
 Great .
 Sorry .
 Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine .
 Mm .
 So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . It's it's pointless .
 Mm .
 Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ .
 Uh so yeah , they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . Um the other suggestion , and I I have a feeling that
 Mm .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 That does get annoying .
 we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or , or uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . Uh um
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 So , the key layout and design are really crucial . You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of uh , good layout and bad layout
 uh
 from our manufacturing department . So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 it's sort of confusing for the user . Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . And for something for kids .
 Do we have an uh example of a good one ?
 Brilliant .
 Uh-huh .
 Well
 Yeah . Um .
 Yeah .
 And so ,
 yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . I think it should be more general . I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . And , yeah , that's it for me .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay . Well let's um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? The um
 The the um the interface type we're going for
 So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . So , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . Um .
 Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons .
 I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Uh .
 And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that .
 Yeah .
 Okay , and we're not yeah . Are we gonna hav hav an are we d have we decided on whether
 Well now that we've decided on our
 w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go for something
 Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , but um
 We're
 Maybe we can
 Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Okay . Okey-dokey .
 Yeah , I don't have any other questions on this .
 Let's move over to
 I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . But I think that should be I mean um , I can speak with the button department , but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . So that should be simple .
 Yeah , sure .
 .
 Yeah , the button that just does that , yeah .
 Cool .
**********
 Right .
 Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets
 Mm yeah .
 and what the fashions are for next year . Um .
 So yes , so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed . Um the most important aspect is look and feel . So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . So it has to be
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ?
 Yep .
 Exactly . Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . So
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 What's that mean ?
 Technologically it should be like um work , basically , I guess . It should work .
 Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market .
 Should
 That's new .
 Okay , now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Actually , I mean , these first two points we've already sort of gone away from , 'cause our rubber one is not fancy I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . If that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction . And it's it's not technologically innovative either .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 So , no loose
 Maybe we could um
 Mm .
 That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , like people and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know ,
 at the end of the day whether it works properly or not .
 Of course , they do . One hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not .
 Well , they do , but it's like it's not
 Yeah , but it looks good . If it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration .
 Okay , well , what do you two think about this ?
 So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other
 But like
 electronics ?
 Yeah , what I don't understand what m
 You could always insert , yeah .
 Yeah , that's basically what it allows you to do , right ?
 Yeah , and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television .
 Yeah , but , I mean , people like
 It would that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , does it ?
 Well , if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art .
 Well
 That would mean we'd have to make a television as well .
 Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now .
 Things like that .
 No , that would be your telephone in with your television .
 Yeah , the that wouldn't be the remote so much , I mean
 No i
 Yeah , and i
 No , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to
 Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically . An and there is no there is no such thing .
 I with the television , yeah . I was just trying to find an advantage . Wha what w what advantage would you get for the
 Mm .
 Well , it doesn't
 Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . Whether it's a battery it could be something really
 really minor , you know , like but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have
 Okay .
 and um just go creative .
 Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet .
 Okay . Yeah , this that's that's very good .
 And then you can market it . Never have to change a battery again .
 Change the batteries ever again .
 And and this is all tying in very nicely . The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it .
 Yeah , well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much .
 Yes , so can
 I think , safety s
 But yeah , by the squeezing it the
 Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator .
 Yeah , that's a great idea . Well done .
 Yeah .
 Third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use . And I think we've all um worked that out . Um okay , in the fashion , how it's supposed to look . Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . So next year people will be buying , I found this really funny , you know , strawberry shaped chairs ,
 we're all about that .
 Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them .
 and things .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Rubber things .
 I wanna watch the pineapple channel .
 Um and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is yeah , so we're in .
 .
 Well spongy , that's where . Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there .
 Yeah , that's great for us .
 Yeah . And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , basically .
 So yeah .
 Okay .
 .
 I had to say
 So we're moving in the right direction like
 Right .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 Yeah , that's great .
 Mm .
**********
 Alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , so through all that we've we go we're right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , that's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries ,
 and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though .
 No vegetables .
 Yeah , I don't know how we incorporate
 .
 We don't have to follow every trend , I guess .
 Maybe make it like fruity colours or something .
 Some sort .
 Uh-huh .
 Or
 The power button could be like a big apple or something .
 Mm .
 Well yeah , but Apple would sue you for that .
 Yeah , this is true .
 They don they don't own all images of apples .
 sued the Beatles so
 Okay , we'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate .
 Well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is
 its image .
 .
 Like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , or like are we going yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ?
 Well
 I think , if it's rubber
 it needs to be
 I mean you said earlier on i it should be funky .
 different . I think , it's it should be I mean , what do you associate with rubber ? You know like
 L keep it clean , keep it clean .
 really different colours basically . Okay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material that material ? Um Um like I'm just thinking bright colours .
 Yeah .
 Bright natural colours , nothing
 too
 Bright , but not too bright .
 Bright , but too not yeah . Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like
 Yeah .
 Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ?
 Mm .
 Yeah . And on the back of it have the logo .
 Okay , what ?
 Yeah .
 Sure .
 Why not ?
 Okay .
 The one thing I'm wondering about , I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote . I mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ?
 Tha
 Yeah , I mean we that's we we
 Yeah .
 This is the remote control tomato .
 Well
 I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool .
 Like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I wanna buy that one . And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's um
 like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around . Especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and
 Yeah .
 Yeah . The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but
 Well , it's it's gotta be chew proof .
 Yeah . So so it's rea it's quite it's quite like um user friendly and also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something .
 I'm gonna write that down .
 So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the
 Yeah .
 That's yeah .
 Mm .
 So like you walk in , you're like , oh I like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour wow . So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . So they also get to pick .
 Well , personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour .
 Yeah I mean , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod , where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing .
 It's um
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Mm .
 D you've got the
 Although I'd be curious to see how many uh
 You know , there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose , and I would be curious how many people choose that colour .
 Right .
 Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know , if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 And produce less of the silly colours , maybe .
 Mm .
**********
 Okay . Alright . Well um , we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um
 is
 from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design .
 Yep .
 Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know come up with the the user interface design . Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this . You won't be going off to your separate offices .
 Alright .
 Okay .
 Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay .
 Oh right .
 I think , yeah , it's gonna you know , come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas . 'Cause at the moment , uh you know , it's it's hard . We were kinda going , yeah , it's gotta feel nice , it's gotta look cool and that it's you know now we can actually start ,
 Mm .
 Cool .
 Yeah .
 It is .
 you know , s some sort of physical something or other .
 That sounds good .
 Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation .
 Evaluation .
 Um .
