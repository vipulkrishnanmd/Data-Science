**********
 Yes , well uh

 This is it .
 Well , thank you . Uh , now
 It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber .
 And and and this too .
 The
 the sides . And the rest is hard plastic .
 Yes .
 And uh
 We uh we had some uh We had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside . And then it covers the these buttons
 Okay .
 until here or something . And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .
 Yes .
 Mm-hmm .
 So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu .
 And then it can break .
 Okay . And the buttons ?
 Uh , well uh
 Big .
 Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh yeah , and the mute and the the other button . Yeah .
 Channel higher channel button .
 .
 Yeah .
 And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .
 Uh , yes . Yes , that's uh
 Yes .
 Very obvious .
 Up is channel up . Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down .
 Yeah .
 Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ .
 What's the R_R_ d
 The R_R_ ?
 R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .
 Okay . Very good .
 So , we have
 That's on the rub rubber part .
 Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here .
 Oh .
 Yeah ?
 So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good . So , that's it .
**********
 That's prototype . Now , the finance .
 We don't know if it's th it if it's okay . So , I'm gonna look . We have Sorry ?
 Alright .
 Do we Do we change the
 Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?
 Finance is um Yeah it's
 No , first uh
 Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet . Sorry .
 Okay . That's uh um That can be none .
**********
 Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up .
 Uh-oh . Okay .
 Um , yeah . Well , we uh uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences .
 Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document .
 Yeah .
 Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document
 Criteria .
 You So we open up that blank here . Um
 Think I can Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can
 get a number in here .
 Hmm .
 No , it's okay .
 Well , uh we can't do that .
 I'll get it .
 Oh , it's okay .
 Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative .
 Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together .
 And in the end , we will c uh count an average
 of all rating . The first uh on each item .
 What do you think ?
 Yeah , I think it's uh Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ .
 So , it Um , I think I will give it a yeah , yeah , yeah , a four . Hmm .
 I think the scroll-button is something also uh new .
 What uh not anoth uh , not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an
 seven . Si six six . Sorry , six .
 Yeah .
 So now i I think you uh see it um its statement . And you true or false . And true is one .
 Oh , true or false . Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two . Sorry .
 So , yeah . Yeah .
 Two .
 You ?
 Three .
 Me too . So it's a three .
 'Kay . Um , well
 It's a one . The first item .
 So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .
 Mm
 Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that .
 So it's a
 That's uh a six .
 Five .
 Mm , four .
 Yes , it's for the
 younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people .
 Yeah , but it's it's
 So I think it's four .
 Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . So I mean , the colours are for young people , but
 Mm-hmm .
 No .
 Yes . So , I think it's four .
 older
 Yeah .
 Maybe version uh three point O_ uh has other colours .
 Yeah . Maybe .
 Okay . Give it a four . Yep .
 Four .
 Four . Uh , okay . Mm .
 We put the fashion in electronics .
 That's uh the motto of our company .
 Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ?
 I um Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two .
 Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh
 techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two .
 Yes . Two .
 Two .
 Uh , I say uh a five . It's not fashion , it's new .
 It must be a fashion .
 But it isn't . Yes . It w If it's not a fashion
 It it will be fashion .
 we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five .
 Uh Okay .
 Then make it th three .
 Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too . Yeah , agree ?
 No . Oh . I use my feet though .
 'Kay . Three is okay .
 Oh , we'll wait outside .
 A three .
 Okay .
 Yeah okay .
 The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five .
 I give it a one .
 .
 Yes , a one . I like it .
 Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half .
 We have to do our uh Two or three ? Two . Okay .
 Say two . Two .
 Okay , two .
 So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep .
 Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average .
 So , um that's why it's a negative in it .
 Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to uh this fashion , I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers .
 But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two .
 One .
 You ?
 One .
 Me too . One .
 One .
 Um , but where where is the ?
 Next , six .
 It does not get lost easily .
 So
 Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?
 Uh Just a small thing .
 Yes .
 No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? I don't think so .
 Yeah , but uh
 Yeah .
 Ah . Yellow . Looks like a pistol . Uh
 Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So
 It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .
 No .
 It won't get lost . So
 Yeah .
 Uh
 It won't .
 A one ?
 Yeah , o one .
 Yeah .
 Okay , a one . Next .
 One .
 Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .
 Yeah me
 Yeah . Me too .
 That was our target . Two .
 Two . Yeah ? Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yep . Right .
 There's a fancy look-and-feel .
 Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ?
 I would say yes . So um
 Well , let's also give this a two . T
 I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy trendy .
 Okay .
 Yes , a one .
 I say a two .
 It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy . So I think s two is better .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , okay .
 Okay . Two . And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends .
 Two is okay . .
 No , it's new . Innovation .
 If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh
 We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . So , I would did not give this uh a one or two . I We'll go for a three .
 Oh .
 I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh
 .
 Yes .
 But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two .
 Okay .
 Mm , three .
 Me too . Three .
 A three .
 Yeah .
 Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating . So , we will do that . Yes .
 Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , . Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third .
 By nine .
 Two .
 Yeah . Um , uh okay .
 Two .
 Yep .
 Come on .
 Uh , nah .
 Okay .
 So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think .
 Yes .
 So , it's good .
 So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job .
 Okay . Thank you .
 Yeah , I think .
 Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes .
 And I closed your slide-show .
**********
 Okay . Back to my uh
 Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming .
 Yep .
 Next please . So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ?
 Next .
 Finance .
 Um , so if uh I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery .
 Mm-hmm .
 Cheapest there is .
 Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip .
 Expensive .
 Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print .
 We have that one .
 Well , it's the most advanced .
 We have the simple , regular and advanced .
 Advanced .
 We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved .
 So
 Then we have plastic , wood , rubber . we have half rubber , half plastic .
 Mm , yes .
 No titanium . Special colour .
 Yes , yellow .
 Yeah .
 Uh , yellow .
 Mm , yeah .
 Interface , push-button .
 Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . So , we have the L_C_D_
 We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ?
 One .
 One .
 And it's not really a s
 Joystick uh thing .
 .
 Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement . Special colour . We already Uh , that's the from the for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour .
 Mm , yeah .
 So , then uh then then then then then then
 Then
 We're not gonna make it .
 Uh , no . It's too expensive .
 Yeah . Wh
 So , we have to change something . Fifteen Euros . Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve .
 What what are the costs ?
 Fifteen .
 We have rubber , special colour .
 .
 We would have uh n
 A special colour . Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour .
 Oh , no , we No , it's uh
 Sorry ?
 Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ?
 For a remote control . I've For a remote control , I think it is .
 What ?
 Yeah .
 If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick .
 For up down left right .
 Um , then we uh lose
 two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much .
 Exactly the special colours .
 And what if we use only one sort of um
 So
 Um just only plastic or only rubber ?
 That's one Euro .
 One Euro discount .
 So , I don't think that's good .
 Mm
 I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ .
 If
 If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left .
 Yes .
 Then it's
 only thirteen Euros .
 And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ?
 So uh yeah .
 Yeah . Then you have Or you have to cut this off .
 Uh uh-uh .
 Then it's not good anymore . So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look .
 No .
 We
 And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour it's a normal colour , wh No one will see it .
 Yellow rubber .
 Yeah , normal .
 Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left .
 Uh
 And it's twelve Euros , I think .
 One minute , please . Uh Is it maximum . Um
 Yeah , it's normal colour .
 But if you lose the
 joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?
 No . Uh , no , no , no . Uh
 Or it's then a regular ?
 Oh , wait wait wait .
 The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?
 Yeah .
 Oh yeah .
 So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .
 Oh yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
 And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?
 If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .
 Yeah , regular chip . But
 Is it a good design ?
 Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have
 the L_C_D_ .
 If uh
 So , the T_V_s has to uh have to be up-to-date .
 If we have the n no buttons If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have uh , we have thirteen Euros ?
 Yeah .
 Mm , yes .
 And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?
 Yeah .
 Then it's okay .
 Huh . No knew that .
 Yeah .
 Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .
 Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .
 Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit .
 And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,
 Okay . All the same uh
 you have to pay
 point two Euros .
 So , all the buttons has to have to be the same colour . But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh
 Yes .
 for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?
 Mm , yeah .
 Recognisable . Like what Yeah .
 Recognisable , yeah .
 Yes .
 Mm , yeah .
 So
 Yeah ?
 Okay .
 Okay .
 So Well
 Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?
 Oh , well that's clear .
 So
 And
 Where's ?
 Yeah .
 So , now it's
 And the joystick away .
 And its buttons .
 Yeah . It is . But then it will be
 just that ones .
 Yeah .
 Now it's
 still , he waited at the
 No .
 Very good .
**********
 Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well
 What do you think of it ? Uh
 About the
 Project .
 About the project .
 process . Went good .
 Uh
 I think uh the creativity uh was good enough . We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um
 Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote . So yeah that was clear .
 Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it .
 And uh no , uh o only the the drawing uh was very difficult .
 But , nah . New ideas found .
 Nope .
 Okay . And you .
 Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh
 Yeah , it uh
 It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um
 Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse .
 Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others .
 And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking .
 To tell their opinion .
 Okay .
 Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions . So , it's good for the speed .
 No .
 No .
 Yep .
**********
 So , I think we're ready . Good price . Evaluation ready .
 Yeah .
 Ready .
 Beer .
 That's it .
 Yeah ? Okay then .
 Okay .
