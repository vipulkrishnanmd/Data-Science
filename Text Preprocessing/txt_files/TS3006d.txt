 Okay . Uh first of all I'll start with the costs , because that's going to influence our design . If you Don't know if you al already had a look or not ?
 .
 Oh no .
 Oh , .
 Did you do your questionnaire already ?
 No n I I already did it . It's not much . It's just one question .
 No .
 Because we have a problem .
 Uh
 Oh .
 If you look closely , you can see .
 Yeah .
 It wants
 Um I already took the liberty to make some suggestions .
 .
 .
 At the moment we have fifteen buttons , one L_C_D_ screen , one advanced chip-on-print . We use a uh sensor , that's for the speech . Uh we use kinetic energy .
 And we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour .
 Okay . What's the first thing we should drop ? The special colour of the buttons ?
 No that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look . So
 Okay .
 Yeah but everything is .
 Uh
 Should we switch to a hand dynamo ? Uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things .
 No .
 Yeah , b but
 Yeah but young people like that . So just do normal battery .
 Batteries ?
 Batteries .
 I think the battery option .
 Just a normal battery then , yeah .
 Yeah .
 .
 It has to be twelve and a half . Or not ?
 Yeah .
 Oh .
 Oh my goodness .
 So
 You're going to redesign something . Okay , so we're at twenty five . Um
 Oh no .
 Uh , yeah .
 Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ?
 Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then . I mean we have to drop on everything .
 Mm-hmm . Uh
 But we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved , but from the side it's it's flat , and the screen screen is just Well you just have to hold it like this then . So
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Um Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros .
 How about Sorry .
 That's what I was thinking .
 Yeah .
 Alright . Let's do it then . Yeah . we
 Yeah ?
 A a
 Uh then we have left
 But we don't have any basic options any more .
 Uh yeah . We do .
 And uh 'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well .
 F_ eight .
 They don't need special colours . Fine . That's more like it . You were saying something .
 Yeah .
 That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything . And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , some more menu options . Yeah . Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons . But um Now let's look .
 Yeah we c could We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing . Everything you can do with with the menu . So With the display .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then .
 Yeah .
 The joystick .
 Uh
 Yeah . Kind of . I was Because
 Yeah .
 Yeah , scroll-wheel , push-button uh
 Integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah .
 If you if you go to If you go to our uh view , like you if you are in the sound system there , uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance , this is just uh an example , y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 But you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound , right ? So you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . So you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button . So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you're out of it . But you still But you then still need to have
 Yeah .
 Exactly .
 Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels . But you still um
 Yeah it's r Yeah .
 You still have to have some some button in the menu to go back .
 So you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . And then just drop all the other buttons .
 Yeah .
 Uh yeah .
 Well not all . Not s not sound I guess .
 But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons .
 No .
 Yeah . It's uh One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button .
 Yeah . So we have to to make it s uh more uh It has to be
 Mm .
 So
 You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . You just drop the Okay and the Back .
 Yeah . Wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ?
 Oh , that's for the speech .
 Speech recognition .
 Yeah .
 Could drop the speech recognition .
 Right .
 S s Drop speech recognition ?
 No but
 Yeah that's possible .
 We we d
 Yeah it's it's expensive , but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition . 'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons .
 Buttons . That's not very easy to use .
 Buttons .
 Yeah .
 I
 No , it can be disturbed by by noise and
 No .
 Yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works .
 stuff like that . Let let let me see what's more what's more popular . I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition . I have to look on that . Let me see .
 Yeah .
 Uh well no I was wrong . There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen .
 Yep .
 Okay . Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen , we need a lot of Yeah . We need a lot of extra buttons .
 But if it
 But it it it's a it's a both a hypers
 We lose our whole concept . Uh so No we just We keep the L_C_D_ .
 No , but Well we Yeah we keep the screen . I mean it's it's about the same . Eight one to ninety one percent , uh sixty six to seventy six .
 We uh we we haven't really integrated this the speech into the system , so we can might as well s drop that .
 Okay so we drop the speech .
 And drop it yeah ? Okay . S Fo Four less Euros . So we still have three and a half Euro to lose .
 Yeah . Let's drop the speech .
 Yeah .
 Sixteen Euros .
 We need to lose some buttons .
 But y y
 Yeah if you lose the the Back , the Okay button Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . And then and then use um
 Then you're
 Oh and the power button we have also .
 The the Okay . And the menu button does also does the okay function then . And then when you in the menu
 Yeah .
 So that's one Euro .
 S so so you activate the menu .
 If we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons .
 Yeah .
 Yeah ? And
 With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . With the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera .
 Yeah yeah .
 Yeah . .
 That would save zero point two Euros compared to No .
 No it's three Euros . No ? Um
 Yeah . To This together is more expensive than Oof , it's almost the same as t keeping this . And we can drop these two .
 No it's it's n Yeah .
 Yeah yeah yeah .
 Well okay . For example if you have f f four buttons , channel up and down , uh volume left right Okay , I've I think we have to keep that . And then and the power button . So that's five .
 It's the
 Volume .
 And the power button .
 That's the basic .
 That's basic . That that's what you need anyway . And then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu .
 Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . Click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . Click again , it's okay . Then you only need one button to move back .
 Or or under each option , you set a you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . And in that menu , scroll , click , one step back . So that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button .
 Yep .
 Which That's even
 But we can't drop three buttons . But I see that's Yeah . So that's not a good idea .
 Okay th that's Yeah that's one Euro more expensive .
 That's not an option .
 Because which buttons do we have now ? Those five which I mentioned , and then menu , and then
 Menu , power .
 Yeah . F of the four things ? Yeah , th power .
 Four arrows ?
 Power . Uh
 Which more ?
 Yeah , if you if you go to eight I don't know how to
 Yeah . Okay . So four arrows ? Uh power I believe ? Uh
 Yeah . Power . Th Yeah that's five .
 We have a Back and a Okay button .
 Yeah , okay that's seven , and one to activate the menu , yeah . So okay that's eight . Well we can't reduce that . We we keep the display .
 And the Menu .
 Oh , well okay .
 Yeah , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . So
 Yeah .
 Yeah , we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display .
 The L_C_D_ ? Yeah .
 Let's make the Let's make the case plastic .
 Yeah well we need the advanced
 Instead of r
 Then I rather make it wood . Because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah but but that's not our market .
 True .
 But
 No that maybe not . But maybe it's better than plastic anyway .
 Ah no , hard plastic .
 Oh .
 Plastic with a with a special colour . A woo wood uh wood uh wood colour . That's an option .
 Yeah , plastic with special colour .
 Yeah ? Yeah okay uh
 No but I I Because we have to use the special colour anyway . You forgot that . So let's go for the plastic .
 Yeah .
 Yep . Yeah , yeah .
 So we do one one s Yeah .
 Yeah , okay . Plastic .
 And since it's not kinetic , it doesn't have to flip around that much ?
 Uh that's easy because plastic is free .
 Hmm .
 Hmm .
 We still have problem of two Euros .
 Yeah , okay . Uh if we dropped uh
 No the buttons , those are really needed .
 Yeah ?
 Yeah we can't drop them .
 Yeah th th it's it's uh
 An advanced chip-on-print .
 Yeah uh
 Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display ?
 You still need that .
 You uh uh
 Yeah . So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total . That doesn't matter .
 S
 Oh . I rather keep I rather keep the display . So the only option is an hand dynamo .
 No , I keep the re Yeah . Yeah . Because we already designed for it . So
 Well yeah .
 Exactly .
 Oh that
 Yeah and something else .
 Yeah but the uh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button ? 'Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already .
 Oh no tha Oh that's one Euro , right .
 And then if w
 And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use . I mean it's not that important , easy to use , but
 No y you would rec
 Then you have
 Th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ? And uh
 Then you still need two additional buttons I believe . For the volume . You can use those Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah d at l Yeah . At least one for power .
 But the
 Oh yeah and power . That's three buttons and this would cost
 Oh .
 Yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now .
 But the integrated uh button ? How many func functions can it uh have ?
 Yeah .
 Three . Up , down , Okay .
 Yeah endlessly . I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . You can go into you in you main menu , you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options .
 Okay .
 You you press it for like three seconds .
 Then then then you should do everything in the menu . On the screen .
 Yeah .
 Maybe we should . 'Cause we don't have money and w we want the screen .
 Yeah , okay . It would save enough Yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left . So we can maybe still use power button .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but we'd Alright .
 Yeah .
 I guess we have to .
 It s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half .
 So let's see , we we drop the price by one and a half . But we still have thirteen left .
 We'll we'll be on
 Yeah . You see ? Oh still Yeah ? Oh then I miscalculated . Oh yeah .
 Thirteen . So still half . There goes the special co Well That would make it less appealing . So that's no option .
 Shit . Drop the special colour .
 Oh no .
 'Kay . What else ? Uncurved ?
 No no , it has to be um curved .
 We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah it says right here .
 They made it very easy for us .
 Okay .
 Well yeah . yeah . We made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it's a cool feature .
 Ah , I don't think I can s uh persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than
 Okay . Wh what we could do is um
 drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons .
 Yeah .
 Buttons . That's Oh yeah since we only have one button .
 Yeah .
 Yeah but I mean what is meant by special colour ?
 I just m I don't I think Uh yeah it's I think it's grey , regular .
 Just something else than than black or white I think .
 S yeah . Alright .
 Grey and rubber .
 But we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though . Damn .
 Of plastic .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . So I rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour . You can still play with it then I guess . I don't know . Yeah , but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working . So I guess that isn't an option .
 Yeah and then
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 The display
 Well , you only have to power it up when you wanna use it .
 Yeah .
 The
 Yeah .
 But if you have to power the for ten minutes , then the
 I don't know .
 Yeah .
 No I don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving , no .
 .
 Yeah .
 Yeah true . Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then .
 Yeah .
 Yeah hand dynamo ? Do you want an extra button ?
 Or or do we Or do we do uncurved and flat ? Instead of
 No no it has to be curved . Yeah .
 Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour . And a screen .
 Yeah .
 Just put a special special colour of the buttons , or something .
 Yeah . Yeah . That's the most import
 Yep ? Instead of an additional power button ?
 Yeah or spe special form ?
 Yeah .
 S what what is special f Oh yeah , special form . Maybe that's nicer .
 Yeah ? It's for scroll
 Yeah .
 But we don't have any buttons . So do d Uh make it a special colour then .
 Without
 We only have
 Yeah . But it's it's for the integrated button , I think also . Or
 Yeah ma make it a special colour then .
 Yeah but
 Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . So
 Yeah . Okay . Yeah .
 Okay . Make it a special colour and then it look fancy . So
 Yeah ?
 Yep .
 So Woah we're within budget . It's a miracle .
 Yeah . Let's let's save it .
 Oh just oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button . Okay .
 Yeah .
 Let's do it like this , I mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we
 Yeah ?
 Okay . Um , well
 . 'Kay , this was old .
**********
 Well we come back to the drawing board then , huh ?
 Yeah all your designs are uh pretty much
 Yeah . Okay .
 Yeah back to work . Uh
 It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing .
 Did I save it ?
 Yeah . I I wanted to go , but I wasn't allowed . So
 Yeah but that but that's the fun part of it .
 Oh yeah ?
 okay .
 Alright .
 Uh I just forgot to save this . Just a minute .
 .
**********
 Yeah what's the next uh phase ?
 Yeah , this the last phase of course , so
 Uh the agenda .
 By your humble P_M_ .
 Hmm .
 Oh f Frustrated . Alright .
 Oh .
 Yeah .
 Okay . Um
 Well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation . But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense , because we had to drop it . Uh
 Drop everything . Yeah .
 Drop , yeah .
 We went straight into finance ?
 Yeah . Yeah it was more important , so I just
 Yeah . Yeah .
 For Yeah .
 pushed up the agenda . Uh ,
 Yeah .
 evaluation criteria . You have t produced something about that ?
 Yeah that that's Yeah . I uh I sure did . And it combines with product evaluation . Uh so
 Uh you put it in the .
**********
 We all have to keep in mind what has changed now . So what we have left on the Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . Alright .
 Yeah .
 Let's make it big .
 F_ five .
 Um
 Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following . Well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah . True or false , and then on a scale of seven points , a scale , as we all know it . Um
 Mm-hmm .
 Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself .
 Um well they are in a Word document , which I will open now . Yeah . I don't know it's open yet . No .
 Alt up
 And we all have to uh agree on a certain level . What's this ?
 Freaky .
 Oh . I don't know . Um
 Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions .
 How do you think about that ?
 I think it does . Because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ , right ?
 Yeah . Uh , of course we dropped a little bit of those uh
 Yeah the us u
 It it it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question . So do you think
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Well , we have extended menus , on the on the L_C_D_ screen . So
 Yeah . You can you can ma Yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus . That's true . I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen .
 Yep .
 I
 No .
 So on a scale from
 one to seven , what do you think ?
 Two or three .
 Huh ?
 Two or three .
 Two or three ? Something like that ? Well we have to choose one . So uh what do you say ? I agree on two .
 Two .
 Yeah .
 Uh y we should fill this in now . Yeah okay . Uh
 Yeah . I uh I say two , personally . But
 Yeah .
 Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three . But now , in original design I say two .
 Yeah alright .
 Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now .
 Okay then I say three .
 Yeah ? You say three , and you you said al also three ? Three ? Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then . Yeah I know . So it's made bold . But it's nah , it's not very clear on the sc Maybe other colour , yeah . That's better .
 Yeah yeah .
 Yeah .
 Hey , you're marketing , eh .
 Hmm . M maybe underline .
 Or give it a colour .
 Red .
 Uh
 Yeah . Alright . Oh , it doesn't have to be bold anymore .
 Oh yeah very true . He types everything .
 Alright .
 Yeah . Um well the remote control has Wha
 Yeah true one .
 Definitely one . It has to be .
 Yeah .
 The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . For example audio settings and screen settings .
 It hides uh basic functions .
 Everything . You don't use anything else .
 Yeah . Well , yeah . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function . But , I mean uh they're hidden in the screen . If you don't want to use them , you don't s you s just scroll over them . And you place them
 You're not gonna find them .
 Yeah . Yeah okay . Yeah .
 Yeah true .
 Mm-hmm .
 F I don't know where . So that's very true , I guess , for our case .
 Uh the second point . It shows the relevant and most used functions . Power button .
 Yeah the next Not so much so .
 Nope .
 Do we ha still have a power button ? Well yeah the button's integrated , huh ?
 Uh check with the Excel sheet .
 Yeah .
 I think we are
 Yeah it's uh it's integrated .
 Yeah we dropped it . You j you just push it in for Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then Yeah . I don't know . Yeah . Um it shows the relevant and most used functions .
 It's in Oh yeah it was integrateds . Yeah .
 Yeah integrate it .
 E exactly just like a m mobile .
 Yeah .
 Just go scrolling and it will activate .
 .
 Yeah uh on the other uh on one side I would say yes , and the other side I would say no .
 So it's I don't know .
 It shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but
 Can you uh change channels directly with with just one button ? No , you have to scroll through the menu , before
 Yeah .
 With the scroll butt Yeah and then say channel . And then
 Yeah . So it's it's not
 Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if When it's on , yeah , it's turned on ,
 Hmm ?
 You say you double click on the
 It automatically has the the programme and the volume function , but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some Of you Or you double click it .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 But but how do you change from volume to channel ?
 No because it has four arrows , right ?
 No , not anymore . Because he's now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in .
 No .
 No .
 Oh yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick .
 Like on the the mouse .
 No we have n we have no buttons left . So the joystick was not an option . So so you hav So you you have to double-click , I mean , for , I mean , uh volume , and three double click for the menu , or something . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Alright .
 Say .
 Yeah that is a bummer .
 Yeah .
 To get into menu . Yeah .
 Oh no .
 Or hold it ten seconds .
 We'll make it a Morse code .
 But but ease of use was not very important , may I remind you . So that's Yeah but that that's not a question . Uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . Well I think it's pretty much in the middle .
 No no no . Uh it should be trendy .
 Yeah . Four .
 You have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen , in the menu . So
 Yeah , im in the menu .
 Yeah .
 Seven .
 So maybe it's more like a f a five . Or
 Yeah . Five .
 Yeah I would go for five or six , yeah .
 Yeah . Five or six ?
 Five .
 Okay five . Let's not diss our remote .
 Five . Yep .
 Five ? Alright . Yeah .
 It's the weirdest remote control I've ever seen . So
 Oh .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 Just one button .
 Well it's different .
 Yeah . Alright . Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . Well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition . But it has at least one innovation .
 But Uh yep .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , it's still
 Yeah , I say two .
 We still have the fruit and vegetable print .
 I say two then .
 Yeah .
 Yeah but that that's not that's not this question . Uh thi uh that's the other question .
 Oh , that's the next .
 Fr Oh I mean the Oh never mind . I'm a bit lost .
 This one .
 I think a two . No .
 Two .
 Two yeah . I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech What ? Oh not the bold one .
 .
 Yep .
 Yeah definitely .
 It's way more practical , yeah .
 Right . Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . It should have been two questions . I realise now , because sponge-like material is dropped . But the look and feel
 Yeah .
 You still have rubber d Or no .
 Yeah . So we still uh we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside , not on the button .
 No you got a plastic .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 The button has also colour . Yeah .
 Yeah ? Okay .
 Yeah . The one button we have .
 Yeah . The one .
 Yeah . Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve .
 Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet .
 Mm mm .
 Yeah . You only have one Yeah .
 Yeah we have single curve now , and no and no material . So maybe in the middle or something .
 And and colour .
 Yeah . S
 Four . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I mean it's
 Yeah or three .
 Uh
 worth the Yeah .
 We have something .
 Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one . Because it's basically an old one , uh with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . Still , it's still hard . I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh .
 Yeah .
 New . Yeah .
 Yeah . But then we would have to drop the screen . Oh red .
 Red .
 Yeah .
 You like both .
 Yeah . I like bold .
 Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo .
 Um oh yeah .
 Mm yeah yeah .
 Of course .
 I just couldn't Um , just one minute .
 Yeah . You just have to draw it .
 Yeah but it be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the
 It's the white part uh
 .
 Yeah . We have a we have a
 Yeah .
 So I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . But
 So
 But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo . I mean , if there's only one thing .
 Hell yeah . If we have only one button .
 Yeah . So I will say that is very true .
 .
 Mm-hmm .
 And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ , doesn't it ? So
 Yeah . The remote control is easy to use . Well I would say Skill , uh I would say six , or something . I don't think it's easy to use , or not so .
 No .
 The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . 'Cause it has only one button .
 Ah i
 Yeah .
 And that you only have to control one button .
 Yeah . It it it has a nice screen . But Yeah .
 Yeah exactly .
 It gives visual feedback . So
 Yeah . Well I I would say a five or a six .
 I would say six .
 I think a five . Five .
 What do you say ? Easy to use ? Five or a six ?
 It's really not easy to use . 'Cause you're putting everything
 No not anymore .
 So a six , more .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , uh I would go for the six too . So
 Okay . Yeah .
 Most votes count . Um
 Um well , another question , uh the remote control is durable . I don't know if that's the correct word . But uh
 Yeah that looks uh great .
 Yeah . Nah
 Definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic Yeah . Yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever .
 In use , both battery as casing ?
 Yeah ?
 True , true . And the casing is plastic , ?
 And the the casing , hard plastic also lasts forever .
 Yep .
 Yeah . If you don't drop it too much , it's uh should last pretty long .
 Yeah .
 So I would go for one .
 Yeah ? But uh I think rubber compared is better . So I think a two is more appropriate
 Yeah . S
 Yep .
 Okay yeah .
 than
 Wow .
 Yeah . Logo . Okay I will go go for two .
 Yeah .
 Uh the last one ? The remote control's a good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics .
 Oh .
 No m
 No we put the electronics into the fashion .
 Yeah well yeah .
 I would g I would go for four .
 uh turn around . Yeah . But um
 Yeah ?
 No
 Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have .
 It's not
 Yeah , true .
 Yeah okay .
 So a four . It's it g it g goes , it's not the best we could do , I guess . But it all has to do with the budget , because it's it's not the bad idea we had , so
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah yeah .
 Yeah , four is okay .
 Alright , yeah .
 Right .
 So
 So if I understood it right , we have to count these numbers .
 That's it .
 Ooh . And Yeah ? What ?
 Uh
 Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh
 Yeah .
 Oh Alright . Word document , the Yeah we have to count them .
 Yeah . That
 Count them . Add them ? Or
 Uh
 Yeah just add them and then uh divide them . Yeah .
 Could somebody start calculator ?
 Mm . I all made it po I I all made it I all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it . I mean if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale , uh Yes .
 Ah we can do the math . Uh
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , yeah . You have to 'Kay . So four and
 Yeah .
 Did you make this questionnaire or what ?
 Yeah .
 Thanks .
 Nice work .
 Okay .
 Oh .
 Three plus ?
 I wouldn't be able to do it that fast .
 O one .
 Plus one .
 Plus five .
 Plus five ?
 Oh Easy . Question number four , yeah ?
 Bo
 Uh two .
 Yeah .
 F
 Four .
 Oh . Wait a second . Oh . It's it's gone wrong .
 How hard is it ?
 Okay . It's your turn .
 Yeah just use Oh there tho uh there's no n There's no num pads .
 Pretty difficult .
 Start over ?
 No it's if you press twice on the plus button , then you get s s
 You can Oh yeah .
 No . That's why it's uh
 It's a it's a bit uh
 Just type in the digits . They're all one digit numbers right ? And then you can count them together .
 Yeah . I think you can just count them by a Um let's move over . Three , plus one , four . Nine .
 Just count it to Yeah .
 Okay . Three , four , nine .
 Uh
 Uh , yeah . Are you here ? Eleven . Fifteen .
 Eleven . Fifteen .
 Eleven , fifteen .
 Sixteen .
 Sixteen .
 Sixteen , yeah .
 Seventeen .
 Seventeen .
 No sixteen . Uh sixteen plus six . Twenty two .
 Oh what ?
 Twenty two .
 S Uh
 How hard is this ? Never mind . Twenty four . Twenty eight .
 Twenty two , yeah ? Tw
 Twenty four . Twenty six .
 Oh , sorry . . Oh my .
 Twenty Twenty eight .
 That was the last one . That was that . Yeah . So divided by nine .
 Twenty eight .
 Okay . Twenty eight .
 Twen Uh okay .
 By nine . That's uh three uh Or le less than a three .
 Hmm .
 So
 Yeah the lower the The lower the score the better , right ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Twenty eight
 Yeah but
 Divided by nine .
 di divided by nine makes three point one one one one one one one .
 So thr t two .
 So we're better than average .
 But
 Yeah .
 I Are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings ? I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . So if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low the lower the better . But if you give true to a negative question
 No .
 Some questions are Yeah .
 Yeah , but there are no negative questions I guess . Good example . Durable use . Easy to use . This is good . Fancy look and feel , that's good . Technology innovation was good , because of a marketing uh requirement . Re relevant most used function . And hides these functions . That was also a good thing .
 No ?
 Durable , that's good . Easy to use .
 Yeah . . Also good .
 Yeah okay .
 I guess you did do it .
 Oh yeah . Yeah .
 Oh yeah yeah . No
 And then matches the opera of the user was also a good thing . So it were all positive questions , by uh by purpose . So
 Yeah .
 Okay . Okay .
 Yeah true .
 Yes , so the It tells us something , yes . Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things , I guess .
 Oh great .
 Things , yeah .
 Yeah definitely definitely . Because now it's just an average It's remote .
 Okay .
 Yeah . Nah it it's it's better than average , but
 Yeah okay because of the L_C_D_ screen . But uh it looks and stuff , it still uh it's not , it's not really eye-catching , except for the colour .
 Yeah . So th
 It's still yeah .
 Yeah .
 Has some shortcomings .
 No . The colour and the screen .
 Yeah .
**********
 Okay so Um this we had , this we had . We have to do a product evaluation . Uh prototype presentation we dropped . So Uh the finance we looked . We have redesigned . Uh not on that , but
 Product evaluation .
**********
 Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this
 Okay it's your turn now .
 So you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen .
 Shall we try ?
 With some casing around it , yeah .
 Black .
 Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ? But are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue ?
 Yeah uh
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah we we can just uh use this one . And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh he only needs one button . Yeah . Or we have to delete this one or
 The the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour .
 Yeah .
 One scroll button and
 It's plastic . And single curved .
 Yeah .
 Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED .
 Oh oh no .
 Oh yeah .
 Otherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well .
 For what ?
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 So that's
 Do we have to do other things ?
 Well I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far . And I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet . So I
 Or just redesign ?
 Alright .
 Yeah . So you made a start , right ?
 Yeah I'm I'm somewhere , but maybe you can help me .
 Should give it some time ?
 Yeah .
 Yay .
 Uh
 Okay , but how do we make the the scroll uh button ? It's just one yeah .
 I was here . So
 Have to take this away also .
 Alright .
 Ah
 And this um
 Uh that's the infrared uh thing .
 Oh yeah , of course . Um pen yeah ? Format . Current colour red . Oh Yeah we did our special colour for the Line widths , now that's a ten .
 The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape . The playfulness , we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 That's conceptual , yes .
 That's enough to get started with , so
 Yeah . Um , uh it's just a scroll Yeah , is it's horizontal or vertical ?
 Mm .
 It's gonna be one str scroll .
 How many pages ?
 Uh , I just took one for every step and then a conclusion .
 Alright . Y you have you have done the first two .
 I think
 Horizontal's easier too , 'cause you can
 Yeah .
 Okay , and and the look and feel is
 Yeah .
 Is it more natural than this ?
 Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance .
 Yeah , yeah .
 So let's say Whoops . 'Kay .
 Yeah .
 Yes . It doesn't look like uh
 Basically .
 The items we had to drop .
 Yeah .
 Uh it it's it's not Yeah .
 It's not very fashionable anymore . But uh it's okay .
 It's really ugly .
 Yeah .
 Where did we start with price ? Twenty six and a half .
 Maybe m make it bigger ? Or
 Mm-hmm .
 Or not ?
 Or twenty six ? Something like that .
 Yeah .
 That looks little bit more uh
 Maybe that's a s a special colour for it . So we can make it uh special ?
 Oh
 This ?
 What do you mean ?
 Like a other colour than this one ?
 Or or speckles in it ? I dunno . Uh
 Speckles ?
 Yeah can we do it uh uh can we do a print ?
 I'm not sure .
 I think we have to choose , yeah ?
 ... .
 I don't think so , if you see the options . But
 Uh
 Okay special colour . We do have special colour .
 Does it mean uh that
 Yeah red is already a special colour , I think . So
 It's not very special , but uh
 Yeah .
 Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ?
 Yeah .
 Purdy .
 Just uh put the purple uh purple on it . That's trendy .
 Yeah . Some some big dots .
 Purple ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah yeah .
 Oh no my remote has acne .
 ... .
 We have the original balance sheet , or Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Woah .
 No . That's why we have that button .
 Oh yeah .
 It's so cute .
 Hmm .
 Oh what ?
 Doh .
 Woah . Just cut .
 ?
 Control Z_ .
 Oh no .
 Is that that ?
 Yeah . Yeah .
 No no . Yeah .
 How the We did we do that ?
 Oh it's it's just one computer ? Or
 Just dual screen .
 No .
 But can we delete it , just with delete ? Or
 We can try .
 That doesn't respond also to the undo . It looks like it's
 Crashed . Oh , no .
 No ,
 Very nice .
 Okay .
 Where do you want some more dots ?
 Yeah , over here . Hmm ?
 You can't even draw anymore . Even children can draw .
 Yeah . Y y you you you push the button or something . Or
 What's this ?
 Can you just push pen and then keep on
 Oh yeah .
 Oh that's the select button . It's uh
 Hmm .
 Okay , it's not the prettiest , I know .
 No , it looks
 It's not so random huh ?
 Lot of options .
 It's okay .
 Specially the the R_ .
 Yeah , the R_ and another R_ . It's called the Real Remote , right ?
 Yeah okay .
 Yeah .
 Maybe maybe it c it can say that . The Real Remote .
 Yeah just on the the m um the L_C_D_ display .
 Yeah . Welcome .
 We can make a l a logo .
 This is your Real Remote .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Like uh put it like the shape .
 Yeah .
 D designed by Okay .
 Something like that . I mean it's not too uh
 That's not their logo , is it ?
 No .
 Do they have a lo Oh , the here . This i this is the logo .
 Yeah . It's a
 Two R_s and a one
 Yeah . You can just reuse that , because the name is the same . Initials .
 .
 You can copy and paste the picture if you want .
 How Shall we do the logo in black or not ?
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 What is that ? Look more Looks more like a campfire .
 Are you dissing my drawing ? This one ?
 Yeah .
 It looks like a ribbon .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 So who wants to draw ? This is actually quite fun . Do we need to do anything ?
 I hear you people are typing .
 Are we uh ready ? Uh Or
 Type in your report .
 Oh , okay .
 I don't see any new messages . So
 Luckily . Yeah , it's uh Yeah .
 Hmm ? Luckily , yeah .
 Is this uh the last assignment ? Or
 Final
 It's almost four .
 What time do we have to deliver the report ? Four o'clock or
 At four , yeah , ?
 Or before that ?
 Okay . And copy this . Just a minute .
 Just compare uh
 This is really bizarre .
 It's
 It looks like there's a It looks like a butterfly .
 Um bug . Bug .
 It's somewhere
 I d It isn't inside . Yeah , and don't know how it's or eject it .
 No it's in inside the
 No it's on the on the beamer I guess .
 No it Oh .
 No , but it i It's not a bu a beamer . B It's a normal T_V_ screen , kind of thing .
 From up there ?
 No .
 Hey , you've got it uh read only . So you have to uh
 Yeah it's somewhere in here .
 Save copy .
 Yeah . Strange .
 This something what's projection from behind , I guess .
 Yeah .
 .
 .
 It's too uh
 Oh .
 Yeah there is some kind of projection I think .
 Yes .
 Yeah it it's a beamer , but then with a within a mirror , yeah . So it looks like a big screen , but in fact it isn't .
 With a with a mirror , huh ? Or something . Yeah .
 .
 So are we gonna change anything to this ? I mean is it gonna
 It is
 Well it's it's single single curved .
 Well
 It's now single curved . So
 Th this is flat . Yeah .
 This is gonna be flat . Yeah exactly .
 It's flat . Oh no .
 Okay . It doesn't matter . It's it's
 But it's it's better to have in the front , this kind of shape , because it looks nice .
 I mean you see more of this than of that .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , more like that .
 Yeah .
 And this is also gonna be
 It's not very uh ideal .
 Nope .
 Do like this .
 But sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work .
 Yeah .
 What's this ?
 That's the detector uh for the
 Ooh .
 Okay .
 Maybe
 But I don't see a detector over there .
 Yeah . I don't know .
 No it's I think you only need two points . Or not .
 No , you sh
 I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on , and then draw right lines or something .
 Maybe that's why it's it's not working , because it's more
 Slanted yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Or just messed it up .
 Well maybe .
 Oh . Oh yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing .
 Yeah .
 Yeah but it wasn't good .
 You've to make it s uh
 ninety degrees .
 Yeah it it has to touch the corners , I guess . But th this one wasn't good , because if I was drawing here , I drew a line and then it came over here .
 Um now you probably have to recalibrate . Oh , five minutes to the end of the meeting . And the recalibration is done using this icon here .
 You have
 Oh .
 Oh we're always long .
 Yeah , can we t can we get to that i
 Ooh .
 Oh it's not working anymore .
 Yeah yeah , it's it's okay . It's working again .
 Yeah well I just
 Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah , it's it's working , it's working .
 Yeah .
 Okay . You go ahead .
 It's better than before .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 We're improving uh Yeah .
 Yeah that's improved uh pretty much .
 Yeah .
 Yeah it's only a bit like to that side , but that is that one by the way . 'Cause this one makes the angle either like this . So i if I change this , it will go there , if I change that , will go there .
 Yeah .
 Yeah but it's better , it's better
 No it
 Mm .
 No . It's better than it was I guess .
 Mm-hmm . I will take this away 'cause it looks messy .
 Silly .
 Yeah . Works pretty well .
**********
 Five minutes before the meeting's over . And then ? We have to present
 Yeah . Yeah . Then I have to uh uh write this , and I don't know if you have to present , because I didn't receive any information about that so far .
 Alright .
 Maybe we will .
 Maybe we get a a final mail .
 So it after the after after these five minutes , you have to
 Yeah . Yeah , I have still ten minutes to finish the report .
 What's this anyway ?
 So cake .
 Alright . After after that five minutes , you have ten minutes to finish it , or Alright . And we uh
 It looks like candle wax .
 Yeah .
 And you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or oh no , they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate . You can just if you ma finish my presentation please .
 Right . Chill .
 Huh .
 Uh over there .
 Uh Yeah ?
 The presentation is still open . So if you finish that then you'll see uh
 Yeah next .
 Next slide .
**********
 Oh yeah , we have to do the project uh evaluation . Just uh do that quickly . Uh
 Yeah ? How do you do it ?
 Uh well basically what that says , we discuss it and um
 Alright .
 So how were did the project process uh go ? Did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ? Or are there uh
 Uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us ? Or
 Yeah the interaction and the steps we followed , and and so forth .
 Yeah well at first I was really stressed . Because it went a bit fast . But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better . And the third time yeah , I mean
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 And we move more to to working together as team , because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . And then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that , and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So
 No .
 Mm-hmm .
 .
 No .
 Yeah , yeah yeah yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 The process , I mean , the interaction between us became better and better I guess .
 Yeah we
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Especially after the first meeting .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , especially if f f if you see uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess .
 And
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Definitely .
 Okay and was that due to my leadership ?
 Yeah yeah yeah .
 Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that Yeah . You were more in charge kind of thing .
 Yeah ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 That okay ?
 Okay . Um was there uh enough room for creativity ?
 I guess so .
 Yeah .
 Yeah but only the the financial parts uh Yeah .
 I mean
 Li Limiteded afterwards , but
 If if you don't take that into account , there's plenty of room for creativ creativity . Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh
 I
 We were pretty democratic .
 the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that .
 So and the uh about the board digital pen ? Uh was that helpful or
 Yeah .
 Mm uh I think in in essence
 Ooh .
 the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . Because it it it just works better . I mean uh uh I've made yeah , uh I've made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . So it it's better a better device than uh
 Yeah it works .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Maybe Yeah .
 than the screen . But the screen is useful , in essence , but it doesn't work that well .
 It's uh it's The the pen is more intuitive , 'cause we're all used to writing with pen . And uh as I said , uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation . But once I get to know the program probably , I mean , it looks better , you know . Or uh something like that . You can
 Use the pen .
 Yeah .
 give it a kind of a home style , like we have i
 the the logo and everything . And I don't know .
 Yeah yeah .
 Yep .
 Blink . Oh .
 Warning . Finish meeting now .
 Finish meeting .
 Okay , are are there any new ideas about this ? All I think
 Well , it It's use especially useful , I guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff .
 I didn't really receive , yeah .
 Uh uh w uh S sorry uh
 And and
 the screen and stuff like that .
 Mm-hmm .
 I think the PowerPoint is is too limited . You can't uh draw easy in in PowerPoint . It has to be uh yeah . The drawing board has to be integrated into PowerPoint , so that you can just easily
 Yeah .
 Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well . You know , you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there , or whatever .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . But it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience , and then to
 Yeah just for text , for text it's uh it's okay . But
 Yeah . These these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things . So
**********
 Oh . Uh we should uh enter our questionnaire .
 Yes . Check your email .
 You also .

 Woah .
 Alright .
