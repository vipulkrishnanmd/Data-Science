 Okay .
 So you must be careful with uh with uh all this . And uh as I can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be . And that has to do with the camera settings , so we don't have our uh laptops in front of the cameras .
 Of our faces .
 And Indeed . So they can see our faces . Okay .
**********
 Welcome at the kick-off meeting . My name is uh Danny Wolfs .
 Uh this is the agenda for today . Uh first a little opening . Uh I will introduce myself , uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself .
 Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to uh to to ourselves . So uh we get to know each other . Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards .
 Then the project plan . What we're going to do , and how we're going to do it . Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end .
**********
 Okay uh , my name is uh Danny Wolfs . I'm the Project Manager . What's your name ?
 I'm Juergen Toffs . I'm the User Interface Designer .
 User interface , okay .
 Hi , my name's uh . I'm the Industrial Designer .
 Industrial , yes .
 I'm uh Tim . Um my function is the Marketing Expert .
 Okay , thank you .
**********
 First a little about the project aim . Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control . Uh maybe you have read uh read the website . It's a very uh , yeah , very uh ambitious uh company .
 They uh they wanna do something else . I w Uh there must be a new remote control . Uh first of all uh it must be original , uh and trendy . That's two things really uh close to each other . But at the same time uh user-friendly . And they have uh Yeah , that's uh very important uh for them .
 Uh there are three stages . There is a functional design . So uh what are we going uh to uh to do ? What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote ? And why are we going to do it ? Then the conceptual design . How are going to do it ?
 And that's uh really global . Uh because at the detailed design , how , part two , uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of If it's uh it's possible technical-wise .
 Uh each stage is uh uh is broken up in two uh two stages , individual work and a meeting . So it's uh it's very straightforward .
**********
 Okay , the tool training . We have two smart boards . This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had . Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing . So uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme . This is called a smart board
 Speaks for itself .
 thing uh Yeah , it speaks for itself . Um and as you uh may have heard , the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen . Not in y the the My Documents . So if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder .
 Uh
 This uh is very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . Well , I don't uh gonna explain it all , because I think you know uh how it works .
 Um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here , uh all must be saved . We we may not delete anything . So uh if you have uh drawn something , save it . Never delete it . That's a very important uh thing .
**********
 Okay . Uh little uh little kinda exercise to uh know each other .
 At uh the white board on the left . Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal , and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal .
 Uh important is that we use different colours , and uh different pen widths . Widths . Widths . Yes ?
 I have a question . Um this exercise , um did the company board tell you to do it , or uh did you just make it up yourself ?
 Yeah .
 No no no . It's uh it's uh I I I must do it . Yeah , yeah , yeah . 'Cause we uh really don't know each other , and uh it's kinda new . So getting used to each other , we can uh have a little fun then , before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff . That kind of thing . Would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal ?
 It's part of the introduction , okay .
 Okay .
 Um , yeah . I don't know really how it works . But maybe you can show us first ?
 Okay , okay . Yeah , okay . Drawing goes with uh this thing . Do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here . That's uh important . So hold it uh like this .
 You g you get electrocuted or
 Yeah , kinda . So , um
 You must p p uh push a little uh Good . Because And uh wait uh wait a few seconds . It's not uh fully real-time , so uh watch it .
 Ach .
 Oh yeah .
 Well I'm gonna paint in the red .
 Ooph .
 Oh . That's the background colour .
 Well , undo .
 Um
 The pen ?
 No .
 One minute please .
 Yeah , that's the one .
 Well , five . Okay .
 My favourite animal huh ?
 It's like Pictionary ?
 Yeah , you can guess what it is .
 The the one who says it first gets a raise .
 May uh paint uh next .
 It's a pork ?
 No , it's not an orc .
 You don't see it uh at the ears ?
 Mm yeah , I have it at home .
 You have an orc at home ?
 Very artistic .
 Thank you .
 So it's a cat .
 What's it called ?
 Simba . 'Cause uh we have a cat at home and he's called Simba . 'Cause he looks like the uh the the lion from The Lion King .
 Ah .
 Okay .
 Miniature size ?
 So we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion .
 Okay .
 He's happy with us , so uh
 he's smiling .
 Wow .
 He does have body uh
 Huh .
 No , only the face . Because we have we have twen twenty five minutes . So we uh Yeah .
 Okay . We have to speed up .
 Remember you use uh different colours , and different pen widths .
 Yeah .
 Okay , who wants to go next ?
 I Okay .
 Yeah ?
 So choose a colour , choose a pen width and draw a
 You don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing . Or
 Save it .
 Yeah .
 You have to save it .
 Save it , okay .
 I've done it . New ?
 'Kay .
 You have to draw uh push hard on the pen or uh
 Mm uh
 Not really . Um
 Kind of firm touch .
 That one .
 Oh . Uh hmm .
 Yeah ?
 Okay .
 Open .
 Which one is it ?
 Smart board ? Okay . And now ?
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Okay , thanks .
 'Kay , I've speed up .
 'Kay , that's fine .
 Line width .
 By the way , why was your cat uh red ?
 Because uh my cat is red uh at home . And I have red hair , so uh must be red .
 Oh , okay .
 Oh .
 Oh , yeah , sure .
 It's a very bloody cat .
 It's a frog .
 No , it's a turtle .
 Uh it's an apple .
 It's not an apple .
 Must be a dog . Yeah .
 A dog ?
 Hmm .
 Colour .
 Something like this .
 Smaller .
 Huh ?
 Oh , it is a turtle .
 It is a turtle . Why a turtle ? Why ? Tim ?
 Um
 'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles .
 You watched it a lot ? You watched it a lot ?
 Uh ?
 It's uh inside its shell . You'll be uh finished sooner .
 No , it's uh
 It's a scared turtle .
 No no . It's coming up .
 Mm .
 Uh .
 Wow .
 Okay , Tim . Thank you .
 Something like this . Okay , you know Very artistic .
 Jurgen , you want to go next ?
 Yes . Okay . Wha Thank you .
 Yeah ?
 Here you go .
 Yeah .
 Um
 How did it work ?
 Format ?
 Performance ?
 And then you have the the current colour , you can change .
 So no red or green .
 And a pen ?
 And uh line uh width .
 I had five . Tim had Uh Tim , what kinda line width did you have ?
 Um
 Uh the big lines were like nine .
 Okay . It's a dog .
 Well , very good . I just uh thought I'd pick the easiest one .
 Uh .
 Okay . Why a dog ? You have a dog at home ?
 Well , we had a dog , a few years ago . And and it , yeah , when it died we didn't get a new one or something . But uh
 Uh , it's p
 Had a dog ? Yeah ?
 Ah .
 It's pretty good uh
 You have an artistic uh inner middle .
 An artist .
 Uh a Graphical User Designer , so
 Hmm .
 Hey .
 Think you uh picked the wrong uh function .
 Wrong job .
 Oh .
 No . Can work together . Ah colour .
 So I think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use . Not difficult at all .
 Wha
 Well , it's okay .
 Okay , thank you .
 That's enough , thanks .
 Janus ? The last one ?
 Yeah , sure .
 Yeah .
 Uh thanks .
 I wonder .
 Yeah . After a cat , a turtle and a dog .
 I think he's gonna draw an elephant .
 I figure I should do something like that , but I'm gonna do something much more difficult .
 Uh-oh .
 Uh-oh . Oh , he is the artistic design .
 I'm gonna design a remote uh remote control animal .
 Remote control animal .
 Exactly . Uh
 Oh . Sorry .
 Well with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh .
 Yeah .
 That that might be easier . But at the other hand , uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and
 No .
 I think it's easier to draw . Yeah . With a pen than with a mouse mouse .
 Better to draw with a with
 Than on the , with Yeah , I m I mean like uh like on here , drawing drawing uh . And then displaying on screen , but
 Mouth .
 Oh , okay . Yeah . W with this paper it's too mu too expensive .
 But what is he uh ? Is it a rabbit ?
 Too expensive , yeah .
 Yes . No .
 Do you have a rabbit at home ?
 It's a rabbit with uh broken legs ?
 A green rabbit .
 No .
 Is it a white rabbit f It's the white rabbit from The Matrix .
 Yeah , exactly .
 Okay , then yeah .
 There , the g white green rabbit .
 So .
 He's a little bit stoned there .
 Uh I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit .
 Yeah .
 It will do .
 Uh uh
 Uh well .
 Okay . Finishing touch and then we're going further .
 Project Manager ? Uh
 Yeah ?
 Where does the pen go ? Just uh
 Have you been uh counting the time ?
 Yeah , a little .
 Okay .
 Let's go on then .
 Well , I think the dog is the the most uh artistic .
 Uh I figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive .
 Oh , sorry .
 Don't choose for youself . That's selfish .
**********
 Okay , now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff .
 It's pretty abstract .
 Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro , and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro . So uh from my point of view , I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech , high definition , uh ultra modern uh kinda remote , for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro .
 Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million
 Euro . So that's a lot . We have to sell uh a lot of uh
 Yeah , how much is it ? Hundred million uh remotes or something ?
 Like how much ?
 Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five , uh uh you got two million , two million remotes . But our marketing range is uh , market range is international . So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh
 Oh yeah .
 Twenty million .
 Two million , oh yeah , two million . Yeah .
 we can sell our r remotes to . At least that uh countries which have uh a television .
 Yeah .
**********
 Um
 So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others .
 Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little . I'm gonna join you at the table .
 Well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control ?
 Um well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . Uh
 Okay . So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and Or just only
 Yeah .
 I think so . Uh but I have some points . Can I show them on the on the big screen ? Maybe ?
 If you have them on uh I can uh
 Yeah . Yeah , I can find Uh .
 Okay .
 Oh , in case you want it
 This is a dead kind of fly . Between the the the , yeah , the the uh
 Screen ? Okay .
 Yeah , be The screens .
 Is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen ?
 No no no . Only All the drawings go there , at the left uh
 Uh but um which The ones we made on the
 Oh , that pen drawings . Uh no , I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there . Yeah .
 Oh , only in Word , okay .
 Okay , I have some uh points from marketing point of view . Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive , uh small , fairly cheap . Uh it's pretty cheap , twenty five Euros . Uh brand independent . Um I think , it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your T_V_ or other thing is . Um
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay . Five minutes . Yeah .
 Five minutes ? Okay , I'll wrap it up quickly . Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose . Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose . And uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Um maybe some other technology than infrared . Uh I rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . Um think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth .
 Okay . Okay .
 That might be a little bit uh expensive . Um
 And something like an L_C_D_ screen .
 For what purpose ?
 Um uh like I said here um
 Maybe it's easy . It's nice as an added feature feature , that um , when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or
 Okay .
 So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh
 From my point of view , yeah .
 remote ? Yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ?
 Yeah , it has to be uh
 Yeah , our company is very uh
 good in making new innovative uh things .
 Yeah .
 So yeah , I I agree with you .
 So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to
 We
 So i i i i
 To the current market .
 Yeah .
 Look , you got some cheap uh remote controls there .
 They just uh
 Yeah , you got a dozen of 'em .
 No .
 But when you enter a new market with a remote control and
 Mm-hmm .
 uh wanna gain market share
 Yeah .
 you have to do something special , I think .
 Yeah .
 But we have to keep an eye that it's Uh at the beginning of such a project , it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool . Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh
 Yeah .
 Yeah , of course . But it's But but this is just from marketing uh aspect .
 And and the price .
 Yeah okay . Yeah . Okay .
 I don't know anything about user interface or design .
 Okay .
 And that's because we have him .
 And and him .
 And him .
**********
 Okay , uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes . So uh you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail . Um the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design .
 Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . So that's the thing we uh discussed . Yeah ?
 Yeah .
**********
 Um one thing uh , we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make . Do we Are we going to use um it it for multiple systems ? Or uh We should have some agreement on that before we
 Okay . Um wha
 Mm uh I I don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . Uh
 I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually .
 I think th that's a pha Yeah . That's a phase further . Ju just uh
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 make some mock-ups , some some general ideas . And and then we can plan
 Ah okay .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 We can plan further , I think .
 Yeah .
 But maybe , because uh you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh How do you call it ? Uh
 Consensus on the , what we're gonna do .
 Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do . So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all .
 Some basic things we co we want to going to do . Uh I think that's well uh Yeah .
 Will come in handy .
 Mm yeah .
 I don't know . You decide . You're the Project Manager .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 W He says
 Well yeah , if the technical functions have to be designed , I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be . Or do we use it a text screen ? Or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or
 Yeah .
 Well , th that's that's really a step further . But if you say uh is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose , that's a
 Okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh tha that's a same step further .
 Yeah , actually it is .
 Why ?
 Yeah .
 Why ?
 Then looking at individual components , so that's actually a f step further .
 Uh .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . And then in the next meeting we decide
 Yeah .
 Yeah , we can take it from there . Yeah , I agree uh , we can take it from there .
 w what it's gonna be . A
 Okay .
 And then you s then you can delete uh
 Or edit .
 the o the obsolete uh details .
 Okay .
 So uh each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important . And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting .
 I think .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
**********
 I must finish off now , so it's over . You uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach . And I see you in uh thirty minutes . Thank you .
 Okay , cheers .
 Okay .
 Sorry .
 Be careful .
 Damn .
 Yes .
 Success ?
 Yeah .
 No . Come up .
