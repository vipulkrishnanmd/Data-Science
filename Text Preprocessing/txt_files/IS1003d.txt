 Mm-hmm . So , ready ?
 No not really . Just
 'Kay .
 Crap .
 Sorry , I I um I'm afraid
 Okay .
 It's perfect .
 Your judgement it's is biased .
 Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype .
 'Kay , so whe where is the remote control ?
 So , we are So
 Where ? It's here .
 Okay .
**********
 let's go for our detailed design meeting .
 Yep .
 So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , and our Industrial Designer , Baba .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 So we'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control , and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost .
 'Kay .
 And in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production . So maybe I will let the our two designers talk about so their You have s oh , sorry . Oops .
**********
 I have slides .
 Okay .
 Ah , that is three .
 Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything .
 Product prod
 What slides ?
 Yep .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 So , this is our product or prototype .
 This is made by clay .
 Looks strange .
 Yeah . Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour , uh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . It's we call it a mushroom design . It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . So this is a introduction of our product . Next a mo
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Uh
 Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but keep on speaking .
 Yeah .
 Okay , yeah , so next slide . So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . Um , and uh
 Oh . Maybe , I hope so .
 Yeah , yeah I'm sure .
 Yeah , that's true .
 the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . So it's quite convenient for user to use it .
 Chan
 Yeah , okay , but don't touch don't destroy your prototype .
 Yeah , s okay . Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so
 uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel
 and there's some cute button .
 You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so
 Everything's mushroom . So we can call our remote control the mushroom .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , everything's mushroom . Mush
 Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape , you know , centre is yellow and t d
 Mushroom design , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it .
 To integrate , you know yeah .
 I don't think I hope nobody will eat it . You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the the in
 Yeah .
 Oh .
 Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . I mean there was fruits yeah . Yeah .
 Really ? But
 Fruits and vegetables .
 Fruit and vegetable , so mushroom was a kind of you know uh
 Vegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable .
 Yeah .
 I don't think it is .
 It's vegetable .
 Mushroom ? Oh , uh I'm not sure . We can it's a veg a kind of vegetable , but you know we we integrated them with different colour .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 So th it's something eatable .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine .
 Yeah .
 I I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know . This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know .
 No , I mean , yeah yeah . Inspira inspiration is
 And inspired colour and and very sophisticated material , so .
 True .
 Yeah .
 And so
 Next slide .
 Uh , no this our only two slides .
 So what we w what I can add is that , you know he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , it is a low level chip , and
 Yeah .
 So we cut it to see .
 You know , we don't need to k . You know wi the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay . So where's the battery battery ?
 The battery it is under . It is in th in in the base , yeah .
 In the base . In the basement . In the basement . And where is the solar solar cell ?
 Base . Here ?
 But we say uh we sa we said solar .
 Where is the solar cell ?
 In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and I don't think so , but it it's might be okay , so . I it might be okay . So
 Oh . Do you think it won't be It won't cris increase the price ?
 Okay .
**********
 Okay , we'll see after . We will have first to so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ?
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 I mean , we gonna try to measure how
 good it is instead of just talking about uh we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design ,
 and first one was uh
 Mm-hmm .
 fancy
 look and feel .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think . Uh just let me check .
 So , four point three point five , it means it's acceptable .
 One one being true , and seven being false . Okay . Ouch .
 Oops .
 So
 Okay .
 Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ?
 Yeah , I think so .
 I think you have nice colours . I don't The sha the bowl shape people like .
 But is it
 Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour
 Uh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really
 Is it really fancy ?
 So it depend on how d do you define fancy .
 Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look .
 But it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing .
 Yeah .
 Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that
 Do Don't do that , please .
 I dunno where the lemon is , but I mean it's not obvious .
 I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so
 It would be bet more like a lemon ?
 Yeah .
 If
 Because i
 I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or
 Yeah .
 Less button .
 Uh
 so , my mush .
 Looks like more fruit . Maybe a pineapple ?
 Yeah , but you don't have any button now .
 Mm .
 Yeah . I dunno .
 And you know , you have the
 finger here , with the buttons ?
 Yeah .
 Hmm .
 That's uh yeah , is that that's a good idea . So that's great . That's great .
 Yeah , it's getting
 It looks more like a pineapple . Sorry . What's the use for that ?
 Uh , for turn turn the ball . If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel .
 I have no idea , so .
 I have no idea what
 And where is the voice recognition ?
 Okay .
 Uh .
 Ah , it's embedded , your microphone . Th this th th there's two two functions . This is microphone array
 Yeah , that's
 Okay .
 Wait th that's the second point . First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .
 If it is fancy or not .
 Okay . Is it better like that ? Looks okay , let's say it's a pineapple now .
 I mean
 So we can we can say t
 The colour , is the colour acceptable ?
 No , the colour is okay , that's fine . I mean it's but I would say there is more too much red .
 So the shape now .
 It looks like a now you took it .
 It's too much red ? In the basement ?
 Um if
 It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . Mm uh
 Okay .
 Right . So , from one to seven ?
 I will give I will
 Seven is the ma the maximum ?
 No , seven is false and one is true .
 I'll gi
 I'll give two or three . Three , it's okay . Three , three . Three is fine for me .
 Three , I will say three .
 Three ?
 Okay .
 'Kay .
 Three .
 Isn't it bitter like that ?
 Yeah yeah yeah .
 Then uh let me
 What other
 The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative .
 Is it easy to use ?
 Feasible ?
 Ye uh
 You said previously that you there's um microphone inside an
 Embedded .
 Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact . There four microphone . So they they they they there's a microphone array .
 It's a micro array , okay .
 Oh . Okay , and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ?
 Yeah , yeah . So you can capture voice yeah , you c
 Oh yeah , yeah .
 Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah .
 And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is
 Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single .
 I
 W Yeah , but
 We have tactile buttons .
 Mm-hmm .
 I see , you have microphone array embedded . You have That's good . And you have , you know this ki this solar receptor that , you know Yes . Yeah .
 No , that's good . Yeah .
 Oh , yeah .
 Yeah , th that's another really good point . Maybe okay .
 I think technically it's acceptable , so
 Maybe two ?
 So using the same scale , two ?
 Yeah .
 Two ? I would say two . You agree ?
 Two , yeah , two . It's it's fine , so .
 Okay . Now maybe the most critical one .
 Yeah , I agree .
 It's better like that , isn't it ?
 Most
 Okay .
 L last one w I would like to judge is
 is it easy to use ?
 Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . But it's just speaking . You just need the command .
 Yeah , it's very easy .
 Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the
 You can use this in this way .
 As a principle .
 Please .
 Yeah .
 Th this is the base . So you can turn to change the channel .
 Yeah .
 Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?
 You just tu turn d d
 I think maybe if you he
 Like if you want to go from
 Oh , ok I understand . You take take the remote , so and you can turn like that to change the channel ? I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast .
 If you hear some click
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah but imagine you y
 Yeah , it would
 Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ?
 Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult .
 Yeah .
 How can you go directly to twenty , for example ?
 No , no , no . I if y uh if it depend on the the angle you turn the
 Yeah .
 Yeah . I agree . I agree . But I mean if you're fro from two ?
 Yeah but y how you need to know I
 I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . So change . Yeah .
 I think something that Yeah .
 Yeah , you have a , like that , and so on .
 And you you can
 Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh
 Oh yeah .
 Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree . So you got how many degree you you it
 We're not talking
 Yeah .
 Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go
 I think you can if you have a scale , so
 No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the
 the turn ,
 Mm-hmm .
 then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you
 Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ?
 It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the
 So you you count one degree , two degrees , no .
 Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it .
 I don't think so .
 Yeah , it's a bit difficult .
 I think so I think so you can do it . I think so , you can just change .
 I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so
 Yeah voc vocal command is okay . But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main
 There's uh also a number , you know .
 Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ?
 Uh , yeah , and y that's yeah .
 And this would be more for browsing , ah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 To see uh yeah uh
 Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Seems to be good .
 Yeah .
 Good choice , mister David Jordan .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I mean you're famous . You .
 And but I'd
 And also you can , if you i
 yeah , what's what's this cherry ?
 You ca you can turn this . Or you ca you can you can also turn this . For this you can tune it's for tune . You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . It's like fine , from coarse to fine . This is coarse , this is fine .
 It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe .
 Mm .
 Yeah , yeah yeah . That's
 Okay .
 So it's coarse to fine design .
 that's very technologic , so . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay the uh th this looks better . Yeah .
 Yeah is is this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel . This is from one channel to
 S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates maybe one of the
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah , th you have the vocal commands .
 Uh it's k on off , yeah .
 Yeah .
 On off .
 Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas
 Most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control .
 Yeah , sleeping .
 Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah .
 That's true . W that why we have the solar ti yeah . So three .
 Solar .
 To compensate . Yeah .
 Okay .
 So , which number ?
 Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three .
 Mm-hmm .
 Do you agree ? Three ?
 Yeah , agree , agree .
 So reasonably , is four , is one ?
 Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . Four or three . Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean .
 So , three .
 And what's your opinion ?
 Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . I'd like I mean this is the just a prototype . I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use , but I don't know .
 Will you give
 four ?
 Five ?
 Yeah , so maybe if
 Uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? I think it's easier than traditional controller . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have you just turn the turn the ball . There's two kind of balls , the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale . But in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah but y you know
 So you have yeah .
 Uh by pushing zero after after the first one .
 You just push two button , zero and and one . And that's
 Yeah , yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here .
 Yeah .
 Are there some buttons ? Okay .
 Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one .
 Mm-hmm .
 It's not what you said previously . Previously you said that turning this was the fine
 Yeah , if you're changing your mind .
 Fine to coarse .
 Fine to coarse . And from ten to ten channels here .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . Ten to twenty and this one , t one two three four five six , like this .
 Okay .
 Uh there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc
 Okay . But this this has to stay on the table , right ? This has to stay on the table .
 Mm-hmm .
 In fact on a flat place
 I i this is just a base . You can just
 You can
 Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it
 Yeah .
 Oh
 Oh ye yes , that's right .
 Yeah , no no , no . You can't put it out . It's just your turning from the base . You need to have everything in hand . If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . It's impossible . You need to put it on and turn .
 Just
 It's
 Oh my God .
 Yeah .
 You know tha that's the weak point , because with a traditional one you just have one hand .
 You use your y
 Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . Nobody would take it . So nobody w will lost lose it .
 So th this is a d next generation controller . Yeah .
 Sure . Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah .
 yeah maybe , maybe may it's the next prototype , maybe we cou
 Yeah .
 Okay okay , okay .
 S maybe we can change from th
 Four . Maybe four , it's okay . I'll put four .
 Four . Okay .
 Four ? Easy to use , four . Gonna say four .
 Four . Uh it's even easier to maybe .
 Yeah , four it's more reasonable .
 You can you can erase with this er yeah .
 Ok
 Okay .
 Mm .
 Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so .
 So it's nine , nine over three . Oh yeah , it's .
 So , average ?
 Three ?
 Three ?
 Trois . Three .
 Trois .
 Okay , so
 It need maybe some wo further work , but it's
 Yeah , especially on the easy to use
 Yeah , uh s yeah .
 Yeah .
 target .
 Might it might be fine .
 So , th the project is accepted ?
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , b I think
 But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 So uh mm mm . Mm .
 That's the finance .
 Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the
 evaluation .
**********
 So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Okay .
 So we need to calculate the production cost . As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . And if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . So , just have a look at the okay here is the
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Oh yeah .
 Yeah .
 Excel
 sheet , so so it has the energy source . We have hand dynamo . No , we don't use that . We have battery , right ? Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose , but we have solar cells . Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? Do you think one would be enough , or such as
 No .
 Yeah , we have battery .
 No , um solar cells , yeah .
 Uh I think in each ball you have three three uh yeah , three , yeah . Three three solar cells .
 as number of branches ? Three ? So , electronic .
 Single simple chip on print ? Just one would be necessary ? One ?
 S s simple , simple , yeah . Yeah .
 Zero for the others .
 And sample sensor , sample speaker .
 One ?
 Mm . One maybe , yeah .
 As we have voice recognition , I think .
 Yeah yeah yeah .
 So the case .
 Is it
 Is sh it
 So we are all already nineteen .
 Wooden .
 Okay , just keep on going , just to have an idea .
 The solar cell is too expensive .
 Yeah .
 Is Yes a wooden pl I and that's There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think .
 Well uh yeah , but what what about case ? Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . I think it's more like double curved .
 That's gonna be double curved , yeah .
 Double curve , yeah , double curve .
 One ?
 One , you have .
 Uh wood ?
 But it's yeah , a a rubber uh
 Rather four buttons . Oh no , interface .
 Uh do we need special colour ? Y maybe , two ? We have two special colours . Push button .
 Yeah , yeah . Y y yeah , yeah .
 Yeah , yeah that's special colours , sure .
 Mm . Yeah , we have four .
 Five .
 Five ?
 Okay .
 Scroll wheel . We don no .
 No .
 It it's more like integrated scor .
 I think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually . Y you tu you turn you turn it , so
 No no .
 Yeah tha that's wheel .
 No no no , it
 Okay .
 Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , true . Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
 Okay , yeah , yeah . Scr
 So , no button supplements ?
 I think the price is okay .
 No .
 Um , no .
 Okay .
 Okay we I think we have problem .
 L_C_ display , maybe . Interface .
 I think we s if we keep on adding things so we have to
 It's okay . fine .
 Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells .
 Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ?
 Yeah .
 Has it changed .
 Yeah , it was stage one , so .
 No y i it did change , but just imagine we have
 Okay .
 We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh .
 So
 We have to delete the the sample sensor , I think .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but we have you the the voice recognition , no ?
 Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really
 Yeah it's the one it's m maybe we ha we have two versions , the first version , the basic version . Advanced version we have speak .
 Okay .
 I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . Because uh it seems that this can be yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , if
 Or it would be better .
 Plastic is free .
 Yeah .
 So , do we need special colour ?
 Yeah , that's one of the requirement .
 Because we have red .
 Yeah , red and yellow . Fancy .
 Wait .
 Red and yellow .
 We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . Black then is a regular colour , so .
 We we can we can we c yellow .
 I think so we need if we try to have a kind of
 Yeah , one .
 pineapple bee .
 Yeah .
 So push button then it's it's the next expensive one .
 Yeah . An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . And I think this is one . Integrated scroll wheel push button . So we'll we have only one ?
 Yeah , thi this might be .
 And push button . So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's uh
 Close to .
 One .
 I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have yeah .
 Okay , so what's the bottleneck ?
 How about we change the sale ?
 Double curved .
 Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . F some
 Something flat .
 Yeah , but flat
 S uncurved . Yeah , maybe not .
 Single curve . Single curve should be fine , so .
 Case , what's the ca
 Yeah .
 Oh , what
 Mm . Nearly .
 Ah we have one
 And then one Euro left .
 Um .
 Maybe don't bat no battery , only solar cells . I think there's a problem with the push push button . We only need maybe just one . Just one . Yeah . So yeah , you will have So one button , and s
 It's it's a bad idea , so .
 Um
 Two ? One . That's fine . That's fine . One s one scroll wheel , so And the vocal chord , it's fine . It I th it's fine .
 Okay . Okay . Agree .
 So we have one button ,
 one wheel .
 scroll wheel with push button on it .
 So
 It's good they're not charging anything for that .
 So , yeah . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is
 Cou could we have look
 twelve fifty e
 Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ?
 Yeah y actually it's wrong . We're not under twelve Euros and a half .
 Yeah , but it's under or equal . It's not written . Sometimes it's under or equal .
 It's fine .
 It's under or equal . It's fine , so
 Okay . Okay .
 Okay . So let's say
 Twelve fifty .
 Wha what yeah .
 It's fine , twelve fifty uh
 Which part is the most expensive part ?
 Solar cells .
 The solar cells , r is i is it ?
 Yeah , I think .
 Yeah , I think it's not t t
 I think , yeah . But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be
 Yeah , to be able to si to sell it .
 Yeah .
 Cheaper .
 That's nice argument , but if it's it's still four our of twelve .
 Yeah , with mi
 It's it is really really uh really very very expensive , though .
 Yeah .
 Maybe if uh okay .
 Okay .
 Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Yeah but we just have one button .
 Easy . I don't know about powerful . Yeah .
 It's easy to use . It's very easy to use .
 Easy , powerful .
 Mm .
 So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product .
 No .
 Uh that's what we've just done .
 We've done it with it is under the if it was low , high or so .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Um
 So
 okay .
**********
 Now
 So
 So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ?
 So
 Well I think we have just have to discuss if
 Okay , okay , it's fine .
 I dunno .
 So did you enjoy your clay modelling ?
 Yes . Of course . This is my job .
 Yeah ? Was it a nice way to create your remote control ?
 Yeah , it's uh
 it's good , to
 to create a control instead of a computer .
 Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end .
 And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for .
 Yeah .
 And for the marketing guy ?
 Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff
 Yep .
 next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it um .
 Okay .
 Okay , okay .
**********
 And new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh
 and yellow .
 Yellow . I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after a fruit T_V_ or I dunno . It can be an interesting I don't know
 Yes , just lemon .
 Yeah , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be yellow lemon .
 Yeah , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um
 It's flat , uh
 Yeah yeah it's flat , yeah the shape is very boring . Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_ ? So you can you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can
 Squared ?
 Yeah , that's right . It's really boring , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Ah , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control .
 Yeah , that's that would be really interesting , actually .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Because the T_V_ you also
 Oh , that's interesting . You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device .
 Device devi
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but just don't trust too much the trends . 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh . Maybe two years it's dead .
 Yeah .
 The fruit ? Yeah .
 Maybe
 Yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects .
 Yeah , it's
 Yeah .
 But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Yeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product .
 Yeah .
 T_V_ is more like fifteen years , maybe , so .
 Yeah , yeah . That's a yeah , yeah .
 If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for
 We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know .
 fifteen years
 Customable T_V_ .
 Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep
 Yeah , yeah .
 Ah such yeah . You've already said mobile phones . Yeah , and following
 Tha that would that would make it . Yeah .

 True . Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still .
 I p is th y the the yellow ball thing that
 Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more is most important , because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control .
 Uh
 Still that was one of the requirements we had . It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere .
 Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_
 Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs .
 Yeah .
 So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ .
 Mm .
 Okay yeah , yeah . That's actually good idea , so
 Yeah .
