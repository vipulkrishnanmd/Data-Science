 Okay .
 Or you get it . Okay .
 No I don't think so it has to be like that yeah and you have to adjust the length .
 Okay , and then .
 So we uh we will wait for Anna , a few minutes .
 Yeah , s yeah , um .
 Mm . Yours is well
 I think you can put anywhere you want , actually .
 Yeah but the the mic should not
 I thin
 It's not a directional mic , anyway .
 I think it should work like this . So I will try to get my presentation running .
 Uh .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Mm . Can't help you with that .
 Last .
 It's no matter .
 Okay , it's y yeah .
 No problem .
 Ah yes .
 Right .
 Okay .
 Then press uh al
 Okay .
 This . You know ?
 I don't know . Just try .
 'Kay .
 On this normal
 Oh oh .
 Alt F_ five .
 Good . Doesn't appear on the screen here .
 Right well
 Oh .
 Wow . Amazing . It's working .
 Okay . Thank you . Uh .
 Hold that .
 Yes and you can put can clip it uh on your
 Okay .
 Somewhere .
 Okay . Mm .
 So , good morning , everyone .
 Um
 Welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project . I hope you all have been uh updated about it .
 Yeah .
 Good .
 So . Yes .
**********
 So w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here . Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . See what our roles are in this project .
 So , um
 We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh
 to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w
 we will also try to uh
 to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before . Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan . You all know I hope how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design .
 Mm-hmm .
 Total .
 Uh then we will uh discuss uh , well , how it should be and uh
 wh what uh what our new product should look lite like . And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting .
**********
 So . Um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control . Um
 We When you design a new product you of uh you of course want it to be original . Be uh we want to be distinguished , mm ? People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I I need . So it needs to be trendy . I mean trendy is what people want , so then I w they will buy our product .
 But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh
 be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that .
 So , the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . Um
 You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh
 then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design . And the same holds for the uh
 ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design
 and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape .
**********
 Alright , but first we will do some uh tool training .
 In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh
 notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a
 a a a white-board .
 Whitebo
 Mm-hmm .
 And um well it should work uh I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . I didn't find out yet how it work , but maybe one of you did , so
 Um
 Under documents in the shared folder . Okay .
 Yes . Do Do we have to say something about that ? I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh .
 Yeah , I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share . And uh , yeah .
 Yes well we will then find out ho how it works .
 Yes .
 Um .
 Well , this seems to me , yes , some computer program but I didn't find it yet .
 So , we'll come to that later .
 So , uh now we will try out the white-board we have here .
 So ,
 I would suggest uh
 Each of us is going .
 Well , yes , um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way . I I'm not really sure how this works , but
 Okay , shall I start ?
 Mm . Yeah .
 Yeah , you can start it you know .
 Yes , a good idea Mael .
 I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down .
 So , i
 No they will record through that . There's a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make .
 Mm . Mm .
 But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 'Kay .
 But it's
 Actually , I think I cannot go with uh
 You you
 D doesn't it work ?
 Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna , maybe you can start . Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 I have to draw .
 So um
 L Why don't you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the white-board .
 M my my favourite animal . Sorry this is all tangled up here .
 Oh , I see uh
 That's better .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yes . Mm .
 So draw it . We will try to guess what it is .
 Mm-hmm . I'm a very bad drawer .
 Weird .
 Um . You're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing . I'm a bad drawer . Okay .
 Mm .
 They're ears , by the way . No . Um close though .
 's a cat .
 Okay so like a pet animal .
 Okay .
 Like a cat .
 Yeah .
 It's like a cat , so I guess it's a cat .
 No , not a cat though .
 What is this now ?
 Ah you forget about it .
 You're on the knife .
 Yeah , uh I think it's fine . I just don't want to carry it off .
 Man , this wires , eh ? We need a wireless microphone .
 You know ? Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that .
 So , that's the cat . Oh .
 Okay . So . It's not a cat , it's a dog . Yes .
 So .
 Mael .
 It's a dog .
 So but that's also kind of cat , isn't it ?
 Oh the dog doesn't have a tail ?
 It's got a tail then .
 B bo both predators .
 Yeah , sure , yeah . I thought so . The dogs have a tail .
 Yeah yeah .
 So , thank you . Uh d did you uh work out cord ?
 So do cats . And you guessed cats without a tail .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I think I will go without without it , right ?
 Okay .
 Okay .
 It'll still not extend , right ? It's not up to that .
 Okay , there you go . So what favourite characteristics . Uh . Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun .
 A horse ?
 It's a horse .
 This is why you're the designer . And I'm marketing .
 Yes . Yes , yes this is Yes definitely a horse . Yes . Oh very good . So
 Ah
 I suppose it
 Ah I think you can put that .
 Mm-hmm . That's it .
 A blue and black zebra .
 Yes .
 Can you can meet them in Africa , I think . Yes . Very good . So
 The very rare blue zebras . Yes .
 I'll tell to get it off my
 Ma Matthew ?
 Uh ?
 Mm-hmm .
 So
 You got a lot of room here . You can probably reach .
 Maybe
 Oh y it's not for that .
 No ?
 No .
 I hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh Mael .
 Okay . Yeah .
 So what should I draw ? Mm .
 He has already to do cat .
 I took a dog .
 Um .
 A mouse ?
 This looks likes a cat who has been driven over .
 Okay .
 Yeah . And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics , right ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Yes , the moustache .
 So
 That's that's definitely a cat .
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh yeah . And i Th They like to sleep , that's why you said you they are like this .
 It's quite , you know relaxed situation . Yes .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yes , okay .
 She has the small legs .
 Th thank you , Matthew .
 Yeah .
 Thank you , Matthew . Perfect .
 It's a very big rat . Or a very small cat .
 Oh a rat , okay .
 Yes , this is certain uh
 some contribution to our project . So . Let's see . Which animal has not been drawn yet .
 And you ,
 Mm 'kay .
 Your turn .
 So you've all drawn land animals , so why not draw an animal from the water .
 A bird . Okay , in the water .
 Ah I don't know what that is . It's a bit
 Mm .
 Mm .
 It's a bit hard to guess .
 Yeah . Put it colours . Maybe it would help us .
 So
 Yeah .
 Yes .
 The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ?
 With different pen widths .
 Mm-hmm
 So
 Oh , it's a shark now .
 Ah it's a shark , yeah .
 Oh , yes , why not ? Good idea .
 Ah it's a baby shark , it looks to me , you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ?
 Mm .
 Oh .
 Now it's a swordfish .
 Why not . A swordfish .
 You have some in in Australia , right ? Yeah . I dunno .
 Swordfish . Um , maybe .
 I've never seen one , no .
 Oh well .
 Yeah .
 I hope it still works . So
 Perfect . So I dunno if we need to spend time on that , actually But uh
 You should go for the next one it seems to me .
 W Well , this uh this tool seemed to work . Let's continue to uh to the real stuff .
**********
 Yeah , exactly , yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Wow .
 Um our project uh finance uh
 thing . Uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros , so when
 designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh People uh
 Twenty four .
 Yeah .
 want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um
 Per remote control , yeah ? Per project .
 product .
 Mm .
 Yes . Okay . Um more interesting for our company of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh um things . Uh we will try to uh
 to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America ,
 Ah yeah , the sale man , four million .
 maybe some uh Asian countries .
 Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents .
 So it's half of the selling price , if I am good in mathematics .
 Yes , of course . Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit , huh ?
 Of course .
 They have to sell at least four million to make a profit
 Mm .
 You all have to be paid .
 Mm .
 Ah we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit . Fifty mill
 Excuse me ?
 Oh you're g very good in mathematics . Four million .
 Yes .
 Yes , indeed .
 So uh well I think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim , I think .
 Yeah .
 So , that about finance .
**********
 And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly .
 Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control .
 Mm-hmm .
 Of course it should have a on off button .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yes , well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , s and it depends what application you are using it for . You might need uh
 Mm .
 We wer we were thinking television . Uh .
 Mm .
 We are targ targeting the television set . So , you need to record the channels . You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way ,
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yes , yes . Th th that's very handy I I always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels .
 Mm .
 Uh
 And
 Mm .
 Mm .
 Uh , and
 And uh just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we You are the marketing guy ? Or th So you are the marketing . And you are in the u use user interface uh design . So just yeah I wanted to to be sure . And I I'm the the industrial designer okay . Because I I don't know you very well , actually , but yeah . Okay . Mael . Happy to meet you . Okay . It's very uh
 I'm marketing .
 Marketing .
 Yep .
 Yeah .
 Yes .
 Yeah .
 Sure .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yes .
 Oh .
 I'm Matthew . You know . Matth s uh Anna . And um uh Matthew , yeah . I thi think you know me , yeah ? right yeah .
 Anna .
 A and I'm Nanne .
 So
 Uh so yeah uh Just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh not face to face .
 Yes .
 So . Um
 S
 So mm
 So .
 S s
 Mm .
 So I
 Are there some other very important things to to do well ,
 So
 to specify in this first phase of of the project . So the browse function , as you m mentioned .
 Mm . Yeah . Oth yeah .
 And uh ,
 you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then you uh Today we have uh um teletext and all those things . Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that , so
 Yes . Yeah .
 Yes .
 Mm .
 Like what ? Like internet on the on T_V_ ?
 Yeah I_P_O_ or . Now we are looking for
 Mm .
 television things or I_P_ . For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet .
 Yeah .
 Ah it's it's it's it's coming up , actually . The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up .
 Mm , well uh I I think
 Actually , yeah w
 Uh w y you two should should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality .
 Let's Let's take
 Of course , and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements . Um then if they need internet , then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh T_V_ over I_P_ . But before
 Mm . Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 But
 Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use .
 Mm mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh
 w we can leave that out , I think . So twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control .
 Mm .
 Mm .
 Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know , you you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know .
 Mm .
 Yeah , but w w we want to design a new one . Mm .
 So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to
 Yeah . No , it's okay , yeah I understand . So we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things and then um
 Yeah .
 The Yeah , the main is browsing . Yeah .
 Yes , but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it . I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting .
 Okay .
 So
 Okay , we are alread mm . Mm .
 Okay .
 So you know now the basic the basic things . And
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 L
**********
 well just just for the next meeting , um
 well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general , I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . So
 Mm-hmm .
 Um
 you will be working on on
 technical function design , so
 Yeah , sure .
 And uh you and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements , eh ? Does it need internet , or or do do we stay at
 Mm-hmm .
 Stam .
 basic basic television uh interface .
 Yeah .
 So , uh
 I think we should now all go work uh uh at this and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 So next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh . K keep it in mind .
 Perfect .
