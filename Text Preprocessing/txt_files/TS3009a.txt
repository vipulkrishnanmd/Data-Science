 I dunno .
 Throwing away my toothpick .
 Hi there .
 Yo .
 Ow .
 'Kay .
 Uh
 Nice user interface .
 Yeah .
 What the
 Uh
**********
 Yeah well , ja well let's just start . I've uh made a presentation
 'Kay .
 Right let's see it .
 uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard , so we can all see it .
 So it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here .
 Well . Very nice .
 Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting . So uh I'm the Project Manager , so I had to fill it in , and uh hmm .
 'Kay .
 Oh sorry .
 And an uh a nice agenda .
 Uh we'll do the opening and then uh
 we'll meet each other , what uh we already do , so , that's not uh very much trouble . I'll I'll show you the
 the tools we have here , so that we can all use them . Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction .
 We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then uh we'll close the meeting , and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here . So this the opening we'll uh
**********
 We have to uh design a new television remote control . You have heard that uh already I think , so . Um we want it to be original , so a nice uh a nice new design .
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh trendy , it's also for young people , and we have to just uh make it uh modern .
 And uh friendly , so size does matter . And uh
 Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place , that kin those kind of things .
 Mm-hmm .
**********
 Other uh
 There happen to be uh three stages . functional , conceptual , and d detailed design .
 Um so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , uh and then go into the next phase .
 That's just it .
 Um
 We have uh these two Smartboards .
 Um well as I just showed , there's a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop . It just works exactly the same as a computer . You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop . So you can uh make uh Words Excel , everything .
**********
 Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , you can uh draw . This is a uh well a drawing board .
 you have a these
 different uh functions on the board . You can see them there .
 So you have a a nice pen , and it's works just like a bal ball pen . This is just a .
 I want to uh
 Oh yeah . Of course w doesn't work any more .
 Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh Does it ? Yeah . It works .
 Yes I will eraser so .
 Wonderful .
 It's fantas fantastic . We can uh uh well you can save a file . So if uh we draw we have to save everything . Don't throw anything away .
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh just we can start a new one ,
 and we just go on , and don't throw anything away . Just uh let them all uh stand here .
 We can delete , but we don't do that . Um you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want . It's a bit uh childish you have to write . It's not as fast as you w you know it , but it does work sometimes . Well it's just like a normal uh
 .
 paint . So it's gone .
 Alright , yep .
 Well we are designers , so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard . So that's fantastic . Um well this uh speaks for itself .
 We going to try it .
 So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board , not my idea . Yes our your favourite . So um I'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo , but I'm going d I'm not going to . I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh
 Alright , your favourite animal ?
 Grizzly bear .
 beast w I dunno what I'm going to design . Oh um doesn't oh .
 I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment .
 Yeah , 'kay .
 Hmm ?
 I just said it's not my idea but I am the Project Manager , and officially this is my idea . So what ?
 Yeah .
 I I I I understand . Alright .
 We're kinda losing time , though .
 We're losing time , but
 Ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose , loosen up , a bit uh meeting each other well uh uh nice yeah . Sh
 so start
 Alright .
 Yep yes .
 I hope our Industrial Designer does this better because uh this is uh
 Don't uh count on it .
 No so a a few legs .
 Do we have to guess ? A hippo ? Yeah .
 Yes yes guess . Well I should make it an hippo now .
 I think it's a mouse or a rat .
 No I don't think so .
 Oh .
 Oh I know it .
 Well what is it , huh ?
 It's a hedgehog .
 I don't know how to call it . A hedgehog ?
 Yeah difficult English word . I didn't knew it myself .
 .
 Well I'm amazed uh about your uh drawing skills .
 Our characteristics sum it up . Well it's uh very uh painful those kind of thing . So we can uh just uh
 Yeah .
 We're going back and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal . Huh .
 I am the Industrial Designer .
 Alright .
 Thank you .
 Chief , I am the Industrial Designer .
 Oh uh but this uh marketing designer .
 Yeah .
 I think
 It's pr it resembles the animal drawn by .
 what kind of animal is that then ?
 It's .
 I think can I say it ?
 Yeah sure .
 Uh it .
 It's a rabbit . Well
 Looks very nice , right ?
 Yeah .
 It looks amazing .
 No no no . What are you going to do ?
 We want to erase it .
 No no . No no save it and start a new uh save it
 Yes .
 These are very impor
 and start a new black uh doc a blank document .
 These are very important documents , of course , uh these drawings , uh
 Yeah well we have to save everything so now um the next one uh
 Yes uh right .
 and then save it and start an blank document .
 You go man .
 Thanks .
 Yeah . There's also different colours and different uh
 well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness . So um well you should uh try it but uh
 Alright .
 I should have made mine a white rabbit .
 Well y y y you could have but uh .
 And he deliberately draws a animal we don't know the English word for .
 It speaks for itself .
 What the uh just a duck .
 It looks like an uh
 It looks like that beast from Sesame Street .
 Nice .
 .
 Yeah .
 Big bird .
 Is it a duck ?
 You're standing in front of it , I can't see it . Alright , thank you . Yeah it's a bird , but what kind of bird ?
 It's it's uh
 Is it a plane ?
 It doesn't draw uh circles uh that easy uh .
 Do we have to uh
 You have to push harder .
 Yeah just a bit a bit childish , a bit .
 Mm .
 But we have uh do we have to name the specific species of the bird ?
 Release your anger .
 Uh no I don't . It's just a bird .
 No ?
 Well wonderful .
 Well uh save the document and then uh
 And then a a new blank document for .
 uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it . No well first yeah . And then you go to format I think , and current colour you choose a new colour . And a new pen width uh also format .
 Here you go .
 Why do I have to do the difficult tasks ? Uh pen yeah that's .
 Uh current colour .
 I like uh oh they don't have pink . Oh b oh think this is uh
 Mm .
 It's not like in paint . Line width . And you can choose a nice one . Width width . With each other .
 Uh ? Uh
 Line width .
 Width .
 Uh fifteen . And I can draw ?
 Hmm .
 Yeah .
 So . Just a wa that's the way we do it's quite easy .
 Uh
 Hmm .
 Mm-hmm . Oh Pussy .
 It's a pussy cat .
 It's a cat .
 Oh the line width is too thick , but oh well .
 Well then you change it .
 And erase things .
 Uh .
 What ? Super pig .
 It's a pig .
 It smiles nicely .
 Now I have to change the line width .
 Uh one .
 So
 These are whiskers , you know .
 Yeah yeah yeah we know .
 Right .
 Uh well I think it's obvious right now .
 Yes alright . It's a cat .
 No it looks great .
 Miaow .
 Well if this isn't obvious
 Well well um
 Just save it .
 I'll save it alright uh save .
 Yeah save it and start a new blank document .
 Uh yeah uh blank .
 Yep . So that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it . Well it's terrific , eh ?
 Well I feel comfortable now . Thanks for this exercise .
 Oh great .
 It's good for group spirit .
 I feel totally at ease .
 It certainly is .
 Yeah something like that .
 Yeah that's it . We're one big happy family now .
**********
 Well then uh the serious uh stuff .
 We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five Euros .
 Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros .
 So
 So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell . we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research .
 Right .
 Alright .
**********
 Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , first about design uh about uh aim in the market
 etcetera ? Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait . We can uh take notes and uh
 Right .
 Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ?
 Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh it's not , it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls , but uh
 Please ?
 No uh I did .
 Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then
 I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors .
 Yeah .
 Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control . On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce . Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player
 Yeah yeah .
 Yep .
 That's alright .
 That would be a nice idea , yes .
 so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control .
 Yep yep yep .
 Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to well fifty million ?
 Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah yeah so a lot of people have to be able to use it .
 No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh
 So
 Easy to learn .
 Yeah .
 Yeah that's right .
 Yeah .
 Yes .
 and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise .
 Yeah .
 I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now . Well yeah ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Alright .
 I also think we should not add too many buttons . Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think .
 Right .
 No that's right .
 Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's culture uh international .
 Precisely .
 Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something .
 Yeah .
 Yeah indeed .
 Yes .
 Yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh
 Yeah right .
 Yep , and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player . Don't we have uh other uh ou
 Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ?
 And stereo uh s uh audio installations .
 Uh .
 We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw .
 Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . So we can keep that in mind .
 Most people do , yeah .
 Well yeah .
 It doesn't it doesn't have to be
 It doesn't have to be , but we can .
 W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it .
 Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_ .
 Yeah but
 Yeah .
 Yeah alright , but
 We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh
 Yeah because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design
 Well .
 Hmm .
 Yeah but it's it has to be useable .
 It has to be different and familiar at the same time .
 Yes .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things .
 Yep .
 yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing you can make it uh triangle shaped , but that's not uh very recognisable .
 Yeah .
 No .
 Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and
 Oo
 Oval ?
 N we can use uh it as a as a game pad . So one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh
 I
 Yeah or so
 Mm .
 Well yeah it's new .
 .
 Not with two hands .
 Yeah yeah yeah , right . No
 but young people want something different and it is
 Well i we already uh one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so
 Yeah but it's quite important that it fits .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Oh but it ha it has to be m yeah . But you still have to know it's a remote and not another
 Yeah alright .
 Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh because it's a long time uh on the market . So the the form will have been uh tested out so
 Yeah .
 Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful
 Yes .
 or else uh they would have been ano another shape .
 Well for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I don't like to use them . I have uh have to it has to fit my hands . When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 It shouldn't be boxy .
 Yeah . Yeah a lo the long box shape yeah . You have to use one hand .
 It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb .
 Nah
 I don't agree with the long box uh shape it it has to be custom made for the hand .
 Why not ?
 Yeah it doesn't fit .
 Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those .
 Yeah .
 But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , but then you have
 Yeah but if you shape it
 No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped . They're all um
 If
 D_V_D_ players . Yes .
 W no w what else ? I di
 No that's ol old fashioned .
 Well
 Yeah .
 Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ?
 I can imagine that us
 Yes uh
 Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end .
 Well
 Yeah right .
 It fits in your palms .
 Hmm . Well but it's still then uh the the long box , uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand , but it's it's still
 Mm .
 Yeah it
 Hmm ?
 Well
 A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand . That's
 Um .
 Yeah yeah al alright but but it's still it's still sort of box , yeah . It it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box , so that's what I mean .
 .
 Well
 Yeah yea
 Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand . It shouldn't be too boxy , you know . It's
 Yeah yeah I understand , but no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course , but in in in at the end it's still this long
 Hmm .
 No no no .
 .
 Yeah .
 Yeah it should be
 box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh
 Right maybe something like this or and then a button here to switch between different systems like D_V_D_ player and so you can I've
 to fit .
 Yeah yes I thought about something like that .
 Yeah .
 A big recognisable button on top or something .
 Yeah right , and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea
 Yeah .
 with the with the numbers and
 We have five minutes left . So
 The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course , and uh n uh uh not too close uh together .
 Right .
 Yes uh that's yep .
 But it should be possible to to um make it
 ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . So there has to be some space between the buttons . Yeah .
 Yep .
 Uh-huh .
 Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . Yeah .
 Yeah right right , and maybe we should use colours .
 Colours , yeah .
 Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them , and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs I dunno but
 Yeah .
 Ha .
 That's kinda trendy .
 Yeah right .
 Sound nice . Yes .
 I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um
 Well
 Well it's just uh about our first ideas now so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . Yes ?
 .
 Right .
 But
 I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make , so we
 Already thought about something tha
 Yes .
 Well thirty minutes we have . So um
 Mm-hmm .
 This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh . You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh . I think .
 Yeah .
 .
 No problem .
 Oh and uh that's uh that's all . So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over . Yeah yes say .
 Yeah now we can still talk about the material , we have some some minutes left uh I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy .
 .
 No n n
 .
 Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons and when I've had use it much it was gone . So it has to be made in the buttons I think . It has to uh not be loose .
 Yeah that's bad , yeah .
 Yeah yeah yeah .
 Yeah that's important .
 Mm . Alright . And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh to connect things uh to each other .
 Yeah .
 Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh
 Yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah .
 I think so . It's a a common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam I think .
 It's not that in China it's different ?
 Yep .
 Yeah .
 But y you can have uh of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between
 And you can use
 It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 But our T_V_s are mostly made in China and that sort of country , so
 Probably yes . China rules .
 And have well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works . The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , but that's pretty obvious , I think .
 But are
 Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ?
 Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes . Yeah .
 I think we should make it universal and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? You can use it just plain but you can
 Yes .
 .
 Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them uh when you buy the
 To make it more trendy .
 Yeah .
 Right .
 Yes . Yes .
 Right .
 And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 Well you can make profit with them , and it's a way to make them trendy .
 Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh .
 Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something uh b a simple colour not not very flashy .
 Yeah right .
 Yeah alright .
 Yeah normal .
 Yes . Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell , so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so
 No a colour everyone accepts .
 Mm .
 Pink television sets pink remote , .
 Mm .
 Yeah yeah yeah .
 Yeah .
 standard .
 But people of often don't like bright colours or something . We have to make it grey or s or black .
 .
 Well young people s li
 Yeah but then you can use a a front .
 Yeah yeah , yeah .
 Alright .
 Yeah .
 I must not forget my pen the next time .
 Well if if you yeah . If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it . I think .
 Yeah .
 Yeah that's right .
 Yeah or a t Teletubby front . Yeah yeah yeah . I will investigate .
 But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh .
 Yes .
**********
 Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the
 uh remote . And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think .
 Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task , yeah .
 Or something like that .
**********
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Right .
 What's the uh url or the website 'cause I didn't
 Yeah I uh w was wondering that too . Y you went to the company website .
 Euro ? Well it it it's if you uh
 get
 It's
 Yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer
 Yeah .
 It's the the the start uh starting page uh
 Oh oh right oh well I didn't uh use it .
 Yeah .
 Finish meeting now . Oh alright . Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so
 Yes .
 Well that's great .
 Next meeting is in
 In thirty minutes , but uh I think it will be you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here . I'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh because uh it's it's the half of the normal size .
 Thirty minutes .
 Thirty minutes .
 Yeah alright it's it's handy to know
 Very handy to know .
 It's totally broken .
 Right see you in half an hour then .
 Oh right , oh . Ma
 Oh . Goodbye .
 W
 Oh
 S
 W that was a nice meeting .
 .

 Right uh see you in thirty minutes then .
 Yeah , see you .
