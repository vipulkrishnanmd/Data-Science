 Did you manage ?
 Yeah , sh not quite .
 Okay .
 You will see uh
 Ah . Hello .
 Hello . So , are you d what were j you guys discussing ?
 No , just uh ask if if he could manage .
 Woah .
 Yeah .
 Okay . Did you find anything new ?
 Mm uh nothing special . Uh
 Mm-hmm .
 I have a lot of new information .
 Yeah , the for uh the trendy uh stuff .
 Great , great .
 A little bit . I uh now will show it .
 Come on .
 .
 Hey , everything alright . Did you manage ?
 Well , I had just a little bit of time , so I hope it's something uh we can work with . But
 Okay .
 Okay .
 What's uh here .
 Yeah , I had the same . It just uh
 Do you have a lot of new information ? Do you have a lot of new information ?
 shuts itself down and
 Hmm ?
 Well , I heard that there was a new uh component speech recognition component , which was pretty much up to standard , so we might use that I put that in my drawing , but again I didn't not have that much time . So
 Oh .
 That's true .
 And there we are .
 Huh .
 Alright . I have a lot of new information . I have a complete list of uh everything that we can use , all the components that all av available . I have no I still don't have any finance information , but at least we have a lot more to go on now
 What the f oh , yeah uh .
 It doesn't do what I want it
 Okay , that's just super . Let me just
 .
 uh
 Okay fine , that's too bad . Yeah , I have to start our
 You need to start it up first ? Okay .
 'Kay .
 Okay , go again . Well second phase , conceptual design . It's fine , everybody knows what we're talking about . So , take you past the minutes of last meeting again . Again you get your three presentate to see what you came up with . So too bad we don't have any finance information apparently . So that's too bad . So then we'll just have to d uh have to go on , you know , the information that we have to make the make final decisions on uh on a conceptual design . So
 Yep .
 Here we go . Anyway , last w last w what discussed last time , you all remember that , that we have to keep the electronics size in mind . Same goes for you . We have to have an easy design with big buttons which are durable and there are people actually spen willing to spend money to do to get more features and uh among those features L_C_D_ screen and voice recognition are very popular . So we have to make a move on that area , I guess . S especially s when when the new uh component is applicable in our uh product , we'll be fine .
 Anyways , well teletext wasn't important and that's what I took . And the consumer , yeah , we aim for young consumers , so that's fine . And well actually we yeah , we did need some more data on finances , but w yeah we still don't have that apparently . That's too bad . Yeah , we need to im de we are going to implement the beep and the flash thing to recover your remote . So one of these interchangeable covers apparently which will make it a more fashionable product . So anyway .
 Mm uh-huh .
 Guess we'll have to do this after the after the you give your presentations .
**********
 So I'll just close this one now , and let's uh let's see , . We have a lot to tell . You had a lot to go on . So uh how about you go first .
 Okay , what t
 I bet
 Yep , that's right .
 Okay , yeah .
 Oh okay .
 Let's see where my
 presentation is .
 Okay , um this I mentioned before .
 Every feature for our remote control needs to have their own operating electronic devices . We need to take care of that . Then warning , uh there has to be a chip in our remote control . And the chip requirements uh needed for a normal button uh is just a simple chip , uh scroll-wheel , and L_C_D_ is an advanced . Of course this is more expensive than this . So we have to decide on that in a minute . The available uh components for energy are , we have a basic battery , a hand an uh dynamo , like in uh old torches . We have a kin uh kinetic provision , then you have to shake the remote control to get the energy . And we have solar cells . I suggest that we uh decide on that one uh immediately . Then I have all lists . So
 Okay .
 My personal uh fav favourite is the kinetic provision because uh I ha
 Um
 Does it provide enough energy ?
 I think so , yes .
 Also if if we were choose the the L_C_D_ option , would it give enough energy Okay , that's the just assume it takes .
 Yes .
 Yes . Because I had the information uh you take uh the remote control , you pick it up at least two times a day . So then it's already shaken and gives energy .
 Well , I'm not sure if it's shaken enough , because
 Is that enough ? Because I don't really see people shaking their remote control before using it .
 .
 Or
 No , I don't think so , because uh watches can go on kinetic energy because they move all the time . But I'm sure t I mean remotes lie still I think like ninety nine percent of the time . So I don't think that's a really good the other alternative were solar cells . I don't think that's applicable because
 Think
 Hmm .
 Hmm .
 Other options are solar cells , hand dynamo and basic battery .
 No .
 I thin why why shouldn't we take a basic battery ?
 And what does the hand dynamo oh , sorry .
 Yeah . A rechargeable maybe .
 Only basic battery ? Okay , but I think this is not a r
 Why not ? I mean everybody everybody knows how to use that . It's it's common . So and it's available everywhere . So why sh mm I think better .
 Re rechargeable basi
 .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but I think this rules out our unit our rechargeable unit . This is really a really basic battery , a normal battery .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but it's
 Yeah , uh it wasn't it wasn't in the options , a rechargeable m module actually .
 Oh .
 Huh ?
 Okay , that's uh . Okay ?
 Okay yeah , b you c of course you could place re re-chargeable batteries . But that's up to the consumer himself . So
 Yep . Basic .
 Okay , but then we don't offer a re-chargement function . That's what it says .
 Well , mm it's not in the list . So we cannot choose from it . So
 Okay , will just take regular batteries .
 Okay
 Exactly . Alright . Right . Yep .
 Next one is curving . Uh we can make a model that has one curve , two or three .
 .
 And uh uh th uh the shape . Of course uh the more curves the more expensive . Exactly . Yes .
 Curves being ?
 Okay .
 Of the remote control itself , okay . I was thinking along the line of one curve . I'll show that in my design .
 But
 But
 It dep
 But
 Hmm .
 Okay , we'll get back on that later . Just
 So we'll get back to that .
 Yeah .
 Hmm . I think one curve is uh fine .
 Yeah .
 But what were the implications if you if put more curves it it's gets more expensive . Okay , so I think with with the extras that we had there it's two curves I suppose . Okay .
 Depends on the user .
 More expensive . More difficult to make .
 Also decreases , okay .
 Exactly . And I believe even that the r the number of options we have on putting things in it uh goes down with exactly .
 Um
 Yeah , hold on a minute . Were were you we're finished ? Or
 No , but that's that's okay .
 Oh .
 Because if there's something that
 Material . I have to offer a plastic , rubber , wood or titanium . Uh if we choose plastic , we cannot choose solar cells for energy . If we choose titanium , uh we cannot use more than one curve .
 Okay .
 But we don't have that so fast .
 More than one curve , uh yeah okay . We'll just go uh
 Okay , I t I'd go for plastic because I have a couple of curves in my design . Well , g let's just get back to that .
 'Cause it yeah , I'm not sure .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 We'll discuss that later . Okay , we have so I think we can rule out um I'm not sure we can rule anything out . We'll do that when y when you get your design .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 No .
 But I think wood is not an option either .
 No , wood's not an option . No .
 No , wood i wood's not an option . Well it it's stylish , but we can yeah , but you can change your covers anyway .
 Okay .
 Hmm .
 No .
 Okay . My personal thought was uh rubber because I had an email , I believe it was from you , uh f against falling .
 Yeah , is it keep in mind that it it's it's uh it fal uh remote controls fall a lot on the ground . So you don't want it to break . So either have rubber edges or a rubber remote control is very durable . But Continue .
 Hmm .
 Okay . Uh
 Yeah , but it doesn't have to be unbreakable , because we do need to keep selling these thing
 No .
 Don't have to be un-breakable , it's p it's a it's not supposed to ju yeah , break after one use . I mean it they they fall a lot . So
 Mm .
 Okay , well that that's definitely true .
 Yeah .
 Mm . I think we have to decide on this anyway . Uh because if we make removeable covers , it has to be one of those mat materials . We have no more than this . So
 Because it well , ru will rubber actually protect the remote control itself ? Because it
 Well , you have for if you if for example if you take hard plastic . If it falls it might crack . And rubber uh kind of softens the fall .
 Yeah , but then you buy a new cover . But rubber
 I'm not sure if it's the it's the entire cover you change . Uh , it's could be .
 Are are we focussi focussing on on the
 Mm-hmm .
 You know what , th we're focusing very much on the covers now . I think it's just w now we're going for the basic design . If we wanna expand our options , f be fashionable , then we can get changeable covers . But I think the basic thing let's just rule out wood for now and continue .
 But
 But
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay .
 Not that but are we focussing on the uh younger people or the elder people ? Younger , okay . Yeah , that's okay . Nah , that's
 We're definitely focussing on the younger people , 'cause that was our main goal .
 Alright . Then I proceed , but I need to know after this meeting . So Interface , uh I have four things to offer , pu uh normal push-buttons of course . Um uh we have a lot of expertise on that one . We have a large history , our company , on push-buttons . Scroll-wheels , uh those can be pushed as well , although that is more expensive . Um liquid crystal colour display and um
 Okay okay , we will .
 Okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 What is this ? Okay , and if we use rubber , I already mentioned that , we can only use rubber buttons . So rubber can only match with rubber . Which one of those are we gonna use ? Push-buttons , that's b uh I think basic .
 Mm-hmm .
 Evident . Yeah , o of course we're gonna use . But I didn't I didn't go on the thought of a scroll-wheel actually . I'm still deciding on what what what could you use it for . Maybe for volume control . Channel , I think that would be annoying because it might accidentally scroll onto another channel . I think a push-button for channel would be better . I mean it for volume control it's it's a smoother motion , you can just increase or decrease . But not sure . For channels will be good .
 Yeah , of cour
 Huh .
 But
 No .
 I think the channels .
 Oh .
 Yeah .
 .
 Huh ?
 Huh .
 Hmm . But
 Yeah , but there is a is it really necessary 'cause a normal push-button can do that job .
 I don't think so . I haven't I haven't taken it into consideration .
 Huh ? Oh . Ah so but it looks cool . Mm no .
 But th the younger people my investigation turns out that the younger people want a little bit uh material that that is uh spongy and uh
 I don't think we really need one .
 Oh . Ah . flashy and yeah .
 .
 I think would be cool , scroll-wheel . It's not that much uh if we take a normal scroll-wheel without the pushing , then it's not expensive . We can do that .
 So
 A sc
 But why do we need it ?
 Yeah , but why would we use it ?
 Think .
 Ah we don't need it , but it's uh it's design a design thing .
 Yeah .
 If we don't need it , why put it in your why put it in your in your if it's if it's not something people are looking for or is useful .
 Yeah , you get
 No .
 I think they are looking for that . Of course we have uh a young target group . So they might find that attractive in a remote con
 Are they ?
 Scroll-wheel ? Uh I don't know .
 Yeah , but if it's if it's not useful , I don't think it I don't think it gives an extra function to the remote . Anyway
 Yeah , that's it .
 Okay . So push-buttons we will use . Uh L_C_D_ screen ?
 Perhaps . I have t I have two different
 Is that s
 What you what what'd you get on the L_C_D_ screen ? Is it expensive ? Does it
 Yeah .
 Uh I only know that if we are using that , we need ano uh an advanced chip in it . And that is more expensive .
 And how much more expensive is that ? Or
 I have no idea . I have no absolute numbers . I only have
 No absolute numbers , but it's just more expensive and takes more room I suppose in your in your design .
 Okay .
 .
 Yeah , but I don't think room is really an issue .
 Don't think it's an issue , okay . Oh let's go for let's say because it is uh very hot in n our target group I think , we should take it take it t to consideration to build an L_C_D_ screen in it .
 .
 I have two designs , one including uh an L_C_D_ screen , wh which is basically the deluxe edition . And then I also have a standard edition , which wi we can also choose to develop too .
 For the future .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Which basically has the same functionality , but lacks the L_C_D_ screen . Okay . We'll pick a we'll pick from uh we'll just combine everything later .
 Yep
 Exactly .
 But we'll
 Mm-hmm . Okay . Electronics , uh the first one is the chip . Uh that's no longer an option , it has to be an advanced one now . 'Cause we have the L_C_D_ screen . Then we have an infrared sender , I think that's basic , we cannot do without . Otherwise it's not s a remote control . And we have the sample sensor and speaker , the voice recognition thing . Are we gonna do that or not ?
 Yep .
 Basically , it
 Yep .
 Mm-hmm .
 Once again I was would ask you if it's expensive , but apparently you don't have any data . So
 Oh , I got
 I only have uh uh relative information .
 Well what d what was exact what you got on the on the new component ?
 I got an email that it's relatively small .
 That's small . So we can implement it . So why why if it's small and we can imp why shouldn't we ?
 Yes , let me just
 Get back .
 Oh how did you
 And there's um get your mar marketing report ? What was uh the last number of how many people were interested in voice recognition ?
 That goes also for the scroll-wheel , by the way .
 Um uh
 Although it's hard for different countries of course .
 The most of them um
 But you have to programme it yourself , I suppose , with your own voice .
 Um uh more than uh sixty percent .
 More than sixty percent of the people would like voice recognition .
 Yeah . Mean of uh seventy percent I think . Uh I'm I have to look it up .
 Hmm .
 If it's small , if it's fits , if if people like it , why not ? So
 Yeah .
 Hmm . But don't we have any w uh information about scroll-wheel ? Scroll-wheel . If people would like that . That's strange , because that's the same story . It's it's not necessary like an L_C_D_ , but it's just it adds something to the design .
 No .
 No , only
 Ah . I don't know .
 Yeah , but we got some data on people that actually are int are interested in that , and I don't think a scroll-wheel offers new functionality , whereas speech recognition and L_C_D_ screen do offer new functionality in your product .
 Hmm .
 On the most spee
 No .
 But
 Oh that's r
 But I think uh we now already have to uh implement uh an advanced chip . So it's m
 Uh I think so , because if I think we're specially w if you're going maybe uh if you have the two editions you wanna wanna give out , probably you have one with uh with speech recognition and
 Yeah , for the future .
 Well , they b they basically can have speech recognition . I mainly focused on the L_C_D_ uh aspect .
 'Cause you wanted to see them , right ?
 There is still time .
 'Cause have did you have all the materials ? Or everything that you desc
 Yes , this was uh the last M_S_ . I have a clear picture .
**********
 Okay , so uh just just go for design for now . Just m have a seat for a second . Uh
 We'll combine everything after this .
 So this is basically the deluxe edition .
 Why is it s why is it squared ?
 I j
 Why is it square ?
 Why did you pick square ? Or uh not square , but why is it yeah , sharp corners .
 It 'cause it's designy .
 It's basically it has some futuristic
 Potentially , yeah . I don't really know . But I just thought that uh in normal remote controls you have like smooth curves and this and that , and this is something new , this is something different , something fresh .
 Yeah .
 People
 Looks like a Star Trek phaser .
 It's true .
 And basically what you can see here is that it has a little , yeah , let's say gap which you can put your finger in .
 Ri
 Yeah . Or Okay , so just yeah , you can rest it on your finger . Okay .
 So only r right-handed .
 So you can you can hold it really comfortable , that's basically the idea .
 Mm-hmm .
 But it but it's only right-handed then . Not for the left . Or
 Or left hand . I doesn't really matter .
 No , it just uh it's a curve inside a thing . So
 Hmm .
 As you can see , this is the remote control
 Where ?
 Wher
 It's on the back .
 Oh in the back , okay . Oh yeah yeah .
 Uh you can't really see it that well , but this is the L_C_D_ screen . So just imagine it goes that way . Then you can see you can hold it in your left or in your right hand . And I also made a quick image , 'cause I did not have that much time ,
 Okay .
 Yeah , I think it's okay .
 Oh yeah yeah . Okay . Yeah . Yeah yeah .
 Yeah . I thought it
 of the standard edition
 which has basically the keys are pretty much the same .
 Keys are probably the n the number keys , I suppose .
 Yeah . I had to do this really fast . So excuse me for the uh inconvenience here , but as you can see , the keys moved .
 Okay .
 Well , you can work on the actual concept or actual design later with him . But
 Yeah .
 So these are basically the two types we have . So if we were to select the L_C_D_ screen , the transmitter here , you can see the light i
 Well , I think what you have to keep in mind is that um you're moving the the the number keys from the top . Uh in the the simple design you have them at a top , and the uh complex design you have them at the bottom . So it would that would give us a totally different design . So which actually making a whole different product instead of two different models . I think it would be very expensive to produce two whole different products . So
 Well we can shift that . But normally , as you can see there , we put the uh number buttons right on top .
 Whereas because we had the L_C_D_ screen here , we had to move them downward , so what you could say is that
 Yeah , uh or for example , why did you pick the mm the numbers uh all the way below , and the and the channels and volume control
 Because these are basically the functions you use the most . So if you hold it in your hand like this , you put your finger in the gap , this is the m most easy part .
 Well it it's yeah .
 Okay .
 Bit .
 Hmm , I agree .
 For zapping , cau because people are zapping most of the time .
 That's fine . That's fine .
 Yeah .
 Just as long as you tak took it into consideration what people would prefer . Uh , okay if you all agree , I'm fine with it . But
 Hmm .
 Yeah .
 Okay . So that's pretty much ha which I had in mind . As you can see here , this can be spaced for extra keys , which is the design thingys .
 Okay .
**********
 No it maybe it's better to look uh what the people want . So I can uh show my uh investigation .
 Yeah , I think we'll
 I think we're going towards the deluxe edition anyway , because that seems to be what the people want . But let's see what's what they want now .
 Yeah , maybe it's better .
 Yeah .
 Especially for young people .
 Mm-hmm .
 Um where is that ? Where is th
 That's mine .
 Oh . Uh
 No , you should send it to the f to the folder first .
 Yeah .
 Mm I forgot that .
 Okay um , let's just assume we go to forty one .
 Okay , now it must be there .
 Yeah , here it is .
 Oh yeah .
 Okay , uh the investigation turns out that the most appear uh people want um um uh look and feel likes is uh uh the s the same as before , but it must be w a little bit fancier than uh the the look of it . Um the second important thing is um the it must be uh technol technological uh innova vative . So that's the L_C_D_ screen is perfect , I think , and not uh
 Speech recognition .
 Yeah , tha that's uh very important .
 And a third thing is
 um yeah , it's uh should be easy to use , so not not too much bu buttons and uh channel selection . I think that's uh what you showed is uh perfect .
 And what the pe young people want is uh in Paris and and in Milan uh it showed out that the fruit and vegetables are uh are trendy . Th they you s you see it in the clothes and everything . And um the contrast uh of it , it must uh the the buttons must a little bit spongy material .
 So uh rubber , I think uh th that's the best .
 Mm-hmm .
 Hmm .
 No . Yeah , uh I agree .
 Mm-hmm .
 Then rubber would be the best as a material indeed . If that is the uh
 No . So we are uh we were focussing uh on the younger people . So the elder , yeah , they wanted a little bit of wood in it and uh that's uh th that's not uh important now .
 I think so .
 Okay , agreement .
 Okay .
 Okay , so we're definitely going for rubber .
 It could be a c it could be a cover . But it's not . Our focus is the young audience . So let's stick to that .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but
 Let's just go
 Yeah .
 Uh-huh .
 'Cause uh n I I I I thought uh it makes a young uh classic remote with uh
 Nah , I think we're in this case you're losing the the focus on the young group , because we're that's what we're focussing on . So I think the spongy feel gives us rubber .
 Yeah , that's why I I d uh
 decided
 Mm-hmm .
 With a fruit uh
 Yeah , w th apparently
 cover ov or something like that . Uh
 Yeah , apparently
**********
 yeah , maybe also yeah , I tend to disagree with with uh with a sharp form . I suppose it basi if you're uh saying fruits and vegetables , maybe it's supposed to be a little little more round .
 .
 Yeah , in in form of an uh vegetable or an uh fruit , maybe .
 Yeah , for exa maybe like uh like a pear or something .
 Yeah , but that's just more a se a seasonal , a trend thing . The idea now is is is that you can uh put a cover on it , for example , with fruit , like a shape or whatever . But not 'cause a n next year it will it'll be something completely different . And then you have your apple-shaped remote control , which is not trendy anymore . So I think that's more something you can focus
 And
 Oh , where is your
 That's true .
 That's what we're doing .
 A trendy
 Mm .
 I think shape is is important , because they s they really extend .
 Hmm .
 Here he here you can put a
 Hmm .
 Oh , that's true .
 Yeah , but now you have your your like your Star Trek phaser thing shaped control . So I I th the edges are really really sharp . I'm uh not su
 Well , you can s
 Uh maybe it
 What you can do is smooth the edges indeed . But that will bring extra c expenses .
 Mm-hmm .
 Or maybe just make it make it up into into a low a smooth curve instead of just less sharp twist on the outside .
 But
 Yeah .
 All uh veg uh fruit and vegetables are round . So it's better
 Mm-hmm .
 I think I think there needs to be a little I think it's too too sharp . The edges are too sharp . The bottom is fine of course if it's square . But maybe just th make uh the top a little round it off on the sides . So I mean y
 Yeah .
 But I think , according to my information , this would be two curves .
 That would be two curves .
 Two ?
 We have one left and one right , and that disables what was it again ?
 But it
 It's some it's something that we cannot do then .
 One cur you could also make the curve go through of course . But that would make make the top round .
 Well we've got we've got like one curve here .
 Okay , that's not a problem . That's only for the titanium . We don't have .
 For the gap .
 But it's that that's for the comfort . It's it's not for the trendy thing of it .
 And we could have one here .
 No , no no no no . What I'm just 'cause you mentioned that more curves the more expensive , so I'm just taking that into account .
 Yeah ? Okay , yeah .
 Yes .
 But let's see , titanium would give us only one curve . So but we're not d we're not using titanium .
 Then w yeah , but we don't have that . So we have
 So the no .
 We have no .
 Well we picked rubber , right ?
 Right , we did . So
 But they uh
 We m
 So basically what we can do is m make these edges a little bit less sharp . But the problem then is that it will start to resemble m the remote controls as we have them today . We were looking at something fresh , something trendy
 Just doodle something on the board on the left .
 form .
 Well actually , we're setting ourselves apart from by technology alone actually .
 So that let's see what you're doing .
 They th these wha are what they call the curves . This side , this side , this is how they count .
 Oh , okay . I don't think like that . Not not really the curves on the on the side of the remote .
 Okay .
 No no . This is what they uh what they mean . Okay , that's not really a good .
 Okay , so that's basically silly .
 Okay , now I uh of course now I understand why they have more uh like um
 Why the curves
 um decrease the the um the size the electronics that can be inside . So Okay .
 I don't think the outside would be called as a curve really .
 Yeah .
 It's like this .
 I think it's for all the basic well , looking from the side anyway . Well , if you see what I have to come up with some designs fast anyway . So
 But you can make uh if you want to use a fruit in uh in uh
 Hmm .
 Okay .
 But isn't the f the fruit like a cover thing , because we
 Uh
 Well , you shouldn't focus on the mostly on the covers , because lot of things we came up with , shouldn't be too really too much shouldn't be too focussed on the covers because it's kind of an idea of our own , but we're not sure if we can actually make that .
 Hey , you
 You can make it like
 Hmm .
 No , but
 Like this .
 But if we put that directly into the design , we limit ourselves extremely . Because it that's just for one seasonal trend .
 That's the one thing I'm also afraid of with this one because it the edges are really um they might stick out on the on the side for example . If you have a basic design , a little m a little smaller on the on the s on the edges , you could put more covers on it , y one one with square or um sharp corners if you want to . So M just round it off a little , I guess , because so we have more options I suppose .
 Well
 Oh .
 As a example . But
 Hmm .
 I d
 Okay , so that's well , that's probabl
 Hmm .
 , you'd just like it to go a little bit more like this .
 I think so because it looks leaner and we should just go with that . Anyway , you have all the time in the world to make to make the final design in a minute with him . So
 So we decided on what what did you guys wanna know again because this is um anyway , I'll fire up my thing . So so we come to a decision .
 Okay .
 Hmm .
 Did you present e everything you wanted to ?
 Yep . So I can uh qui oh . I can quickly make a conclusion
 Okay .
 Uh what the
 of what we have decided so far .
 Uh we still need to decide on a couple of things you you needed to know .
 Ah .
 Yeah .
 Okay , anyway . Uh energy , we choose regular regular batteries . The chip is advanced because we have the advanced features . The case , it will be the material will be rubber , suppose . Wouldn't the b the design we talked about . Uh user interface , type .
 Yeah .
 Well I think we took all the components separately what we want . Um let's see um supplements . I'm not sure what they mean by that . Anyway , um apparently you guys , you should work together on the final design , both on internal and external design . So
 Yeah , you should you should probably find out how the product will fall into the market , how uh what's gonna happen with the final design as we have it now . So Yeah , of course you've got your specific instruction as usual . So Wanna spend some more um I think we're in a pretty much in agreement actually , which is good . So
 Yeah .
 Yeah
 Hmm .
 Hmm .
 Are we all in agreement about the , well , the primary structure of the of my design ? Except for the edges . Like the keys there .
 Lef let's see , where the pen go ? Here .
 Yeah uh open your thing again . Let's see what if you can come up with anything new . Um I'll just do a next one .
 So what would give us your ne your design would be the lights would be on top , right ? Uh one on each one on each side .
 Yeah .
 To create a kind of disco effect when you
 That was basically what w
 Is it is it the lights for for finding the finding remote or lights that it that
 Light for the finding of the remote . We can also use one light for
 showing that the signal is being sent . But
 Yeah , I think that should just be a simple LED or something . Like that that's not that important of course . It just like a matter of a a beep if you pre that you just know that that there's context . So I don't think that's super important . But
 Hmm .
 So we have the teletext we have here , we have the mute .
 Uh sh Oh .
 L_C_D_ screen . This is the on off button .
 And speech w recognition . Are we
 Speech recognition , I where did I imagine . I did that pretty much over here , so that you could use it like this
 We
 Little uh voice uh
 Record and a uh no .
 and speak to it . Then you have the uh extra keys for teletext , mute , two buttons which can be pretty much anything or nothing . We can also just not use them .
 Let's see , I'll just make
 Main controls and a key-pad .
 Yeah .
 One light here .
 And just make it red now . But it could be any colour . So
 Will be fine .
 Okay , whatever . Fine , anyway . What do we have here ? M I'll make it um are we gonna use square buttons or round ones actually ?
 Personally I would prefer round ones .
 Me too .
 Yeah , but that would this was just in the design . Because if you I had a square design . So I had square buttons . But in that case the round buttons would be more appropriate .
 Form of fruit . It's better .
 Hmm .
 Yeah , for
 Okay .
 Okay , I assume it for so we take a r take a round power button right here .
 Whatever . Uh back to black .
 Uh not too big though .
 See this would be good .
 Um let's see .
 Are these for any extra controls ?
 Yeah . The left one is teletext and the right one is mute . And these two buttons are or not necessary or
 Okay .
 Okay . If we go for for round buttons in general , do we want to the menu key in the middle to be round ? For example , if you let's see , put it this here . I think we'll go with the triangles that Come on .
 Yeah , the triangles would be best indeed .
 Triangles are good .
 Yeah , they're a little too big now . But
 Anyway , okay . So do you want for example a
 round button in the middle or square one ?
 I personally think that a round b button looks bit silly , but
 Hmm .
 I'm not sure uh , I just just came up with it .
 Yeah .
 This aligns nicely . So
 Okay . We'll just take the take the round button , suppose . Uh oh the square button , sorry .
 Does everybody agree on that ?
 Yep .
 I suppose so .
 I would prefer round . But doesn't matter , doesn't matter .
 You prefer a round ? Okay .
 Okay .
 That's not a big deal , think .
 So there's our numbers . Think we need an extra button here of course for yeah , like you had for the
 higher numbers .
 And you could include a button here for the mute , I suppose .
 For something else , just to
 Yeah , you can . But it but it's not necessary , becau
 mirror mirror the effect with this . That's not necessary because it you can take this away , but there it looks like there's a hole there , just to mirror the effect . Okay , so we have a few
 We could put our logo there .
 Nah , I think it it would be nice to put the logo here , for example , if you have some buttons here .
 We could put a logo here because it's very always in your field of vision . If you're watching it , the L_C_D_ screen , blah blah .
 And what about Oh .
 What about a button for your uh favourite channel ?
 Oh that could be that b
 Well we could we could include either here
 Uh yeah . With the extra controls . Uh
 or here , for example . But you think here or here ?
 Well now it's getting a little bit too crowded up there . So Is your
 Uh one one set
 I know .
 Yeah , you have to put it up uh
 So it can basically be the button down below or one of the four buttons up there . Because
 No , we could put this one as favourite channel for exam
 One of the four . Uh , it's better than , I think .
 What are these for ? Okay .
 One of the four is better , I suppose .
 It's a favourite channel .
 What ?
 What ? Nee , uh one of the four uh
 Because it's a little bit confusing to have twelve buttons down there , because you're only accustomed to eleven , I'd say .
 It's better th
 You're accustomed to eleven ?
 My uh okay , have it your way . I mean , think this looks rather like like there's something missing for example . I mean why wouldn't you include a 'cause there is a um a piece of electronics under there anyway . So why not give it a function . Let's say I mean could be anything . But th
 Oh , we still need an okay button .
 Hmm . Hmm .
 Well , you could also shift the two buttons to be nicely aligned .
 No , I don't think because this is a zero . But you want zero to be mis-aligned with the rest . Anyway , so this is the basic design , we wanna have um on and off what are we missing ?
 Yeah .
 If it looks um
 Oh , we're pretty much missing an okay button , but we have a button up there which is still free . So
 Okay , so we want the remote to be the s the side view actually , what I'm gonna draw . So
 Um
 probably think you want the curve to be here . So have your finger under here like this , I suppose ? Okay .
 Yeah , pretty much .
 Just gonna be sh
 Hmm .
 Yeah . Want this straight or what ? Let's keep it at this .
 So it would be like this .
 Do we want something interesting with it or see .
 Would give us a light here . Maybe it's boring . You want it curved or what ? Maybe you want
 Well , I think it looks better curved . But that's probably uh
 Should like this ?
 Will give us design problem because we have
 Mm .
 Huh .
 It can be curved .
 Why ?
 It can be curved , because that yeah , it's a little bit more trendy to be curved .
 Yes .
 It can be curved . Okay ? I think so . That's why I asked you .
 Okay . So
 I would curve the whole actually .
 Hmm ?
 I would curve the whole . Like um like it hangs over your hand a little bit .
 Oh crap .
 Yeah .
 Then it will bounce and you don't drop it so easily .
 Yeah . Oh .
 Anyway , so you want to a little more like this ?
 Yeah , something like that , yes .
 Uh-huh .
 And just s s
 Yes , exactly .
 Stop the curve here or continue it
 I think continue like that .
 Yep .
 Then there's also enough room for the electronics .
 So we have our L_C_D_ screen . Let's see .
 In
 But it pretty much looks like a banana already . Uh
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Let's make it yellow then . Uh
 Perfect .
 Bana it's banana vision .
 It's fruit . Yeah .
 Yeah , it's perfect .
 So you have your L_C_D_ screen right here , suppose .
 Um that would make
 We use the colours now . But
 Um
 Maybe once we can make a special edition in according with Chiquita .
 Have ourselves sponsored .
 You got sponsor , now you get a free one with every pack of Chiquita .
 Uh but it's a good trade-off for them if they can have their logo on it .
 So it would give the buttons here .
 Or they can design their own cover .
 Mm-hmm . They might wanna be the first ones to uh
 We could set up a a marketing uh agreement .
 I suppose I suppose we can put um let's see .
 Yeah .
 Um
 Oh , perhaps they can use it .
 Or give a special edition uh with with
 Uh I suppose we can put the batteries in here because it has the most space , for example .
 Won't that be a problem with the L_C_D_ screen ?
 I don't think so because it's the biggest part of the uh of the uh
 Mm .
 Yeah , but the L_C_D_ screen probably needs quite the chip .
 Let's
 I think this is possible .
 I think it's possible . I think it's the best place yeah , you could also put 'em here . But
 Okay .
 Huh .
 It doesn't matter . You can actually uh place a chip for the L_C_D_ screen and at the bottom , and and wire it . Doesn't matter .
 Okay , so we put the batteries here .
 Okay , that's not a problem . Okay .
 Okay .
 That's fine .
 Yep . Blah .
 I think we get the idea .
 Um , any other com what what are we missing here ? Something a speech recognition . Um
 where do we want the microphone , for example , to be ? On the side or on the or , for example , on top ? Like here .
 Top ?
 Oh , basically the idea that I had was it to be pretty much in combination with the transmitter . 'Cause you can talk to it like this .
 W
 On there .
 I think on top .
 To be
 Okay , I w thought maybe it's either be here or because it's mi it might interfere with the transmitter , I'm not sure . But
 No .
 'Cause transmitter would be here .
 Well , the email said it was a quite a small component . So I don't see that .
 Why uh once again , like you said , the component can be somewhere at the bottom while we wire the microphone up there . Anyway .
 Um yeah , it could be either be here or make a double microphone .
 Mm-hmm .
 I wouldn't mind .
 .
 It is , I believe , also able to talk .
 It's able to talk to you .
 It's a
 I have a sample uh sample sensor and the speaker sensor .
 A speaker sensor .
 Uh the speaker sensor we already have , but s I don't know what they exactly mean by a sample sensor . Could it talk back ? Like uh g uh give confirmation or something .
 I think it can . I think if you have a a speech recognition component , then a s speaking component is not that hard to to put in either .
 Well , the
 I think so , it I think it could .
 Yeah . I mean it could be a all this stuff could be integrated into the L_C_D_ screen , which you could navigate with this , I suppose . Navigate through everything . If you have I think you sh I think the advanced options should be I think it sh the advanced option could also be integrated in the L_C_D_ screen , of course , because you don't have to have a button for everything . You can just navigate through th m your menu that you have here for advanced options with this . Think that would be fine . So that's w m would be making use of the L_C_D_ screen .
 Mm-hmm .
 Hmm .
 Hmm .
 Hmm . But
 Yeah , but do you actually need the remote talking back ?
 Mm-hmm . Yeah .
 Hmm .
 Hmm .
 .
 Mm .
 Hmm .
 Mm .
 We already have a sound component , by the way , for the beep .
 So beep .
 Beep .
 Beep .
 Beep .
 Um , so the flashing of the beep , we have well anything . We could Yeah , but you could put a speaker or something on on the side for example .
 At the back , yeah . Like that . Or at the side .
 Hmm .
 For how do you draw that again ?
 Which is .
 Uh whatever , looks stupid .
 So what's basically edi the editi idea , sorry , now ? We need to stay here and work out that .
 I think this is pretty
 I'm not sure . I should be getting new information , I guess .
 Oh .
 I think you have to stay here because we are supposed to five minutes to finish the meeting . Oh , like my the info that I got was that you're uh we're gonna work on our own because you're gonna do the market market uh analysing I'm supposed to do the little work on the year-end report . So the project report .
 Yep .
 Okay .
 You doodle a doodle us a nice nice design for for the next meeting , we'll be done . I think we're all happy now .
 Well
 Mm-hmm .
 Hmm . Okay , I think we're everybody satisfied with the with the current design we have ? So we're s supposed to be rubber . I think well , I think the the remote control is gonna be black because we we forgot to talk about I mean the the company colours are important apparently . So we have the logo up there . So are we gonna base colour is black ?
 Well , I suppose we'll
 Yes .
 Ah , that's fine .
 Pretty much .
 Round .
 Wh
 Why ?
 But we have
 any company logo . We have yes , but and yellow .
 And yeah , of course we could use yellow buttons or yellow navigation or whatever .
 I would change . I would take a yellow remote control . To have it flashy , to have it it's for young people .
 Yellow but yellow control . It's
 Yeah , but when you use covers , it basically easier to have a n have a neutral colour on the base .
 Okay .
 Need do be different .
 It's the colour of a
 Well , don't don't stick yourself on the covers right now .
 But don't stick yourself on the cover because
 Hmm .
 No , we're designing the remote control now , but taking that into consideration , it's better to have a neutral base colour than to have a flashy
 But we need to be different .
 Nah .
 Yeah , but the info . I think we should go with uh with the company colour because what specific info that I got from the project board . So I think we should go with that .
 But , the you
 Mm-hmm .
 The young people want uh a trendy uh remote control . So colourful uh is
 They want something trendy .
 Huh .
 It's either black cover with yellow buttons or vice versa . And I would say take a yellow cover and black buttons .
 It is more trendy . That's definitely true .
 I think we should th then take it take yellow . Take what you c yellow remote control . So let's see if if we can do the LED onto it .
 To be different .
 Yeah .
 You have the basic colours , blue , green , red .
 Uh oh .
 Yeah , we have so many colours already .
 So
 You know what ? I'm not gonna do this . That's up to you guys .
 Oh , it's okay .
 Oh no , that I think it's good thing to be different than
 Yeah . Colourful , you you
 Yep .
 I still don't have my scroll-wheel though . Uh that's Nah , that's true .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Stupid scroll-wheel .
 Oh , where would you like to put it ?
 Yeah .
 'Kay
 I'm not sure uh I really , I'm no I have no clue what we could use the scroll-wheel for .
 Uh you could use it for the channels and for the volume . But it's has no real added value .
 No , forget it .
 Oh yeah .
 No look , it
 You can
 It takes space , a lot of space . And it could
 No , that's not my point . It's not because it's functional , but it's just to add to the design , to have it flashy . It it has no function , I agree . I agree .
 Ah may
 Yeah , but if it has no function , then
 I'm not sure if it if it has no function , why even put it there ? And th that's just so much things that make it look flash
 Oh , so many things have no function , just design .
 But uh uh scroll for a channel s selection or volume
 Mm-hmm . Hmm .
 I think channel selection would be annoying because it just c you could scroll past the channel or
 Ma
 Mm-hmm .
 Let's vote on it . Then we don't have to talk about it any longer . What do you want ? In or out ?
 Oh okay .
 Hmm .
 Oh okay .
 Basically out . I don't see the
 Okay . You are out of course . You are okay , clear .
 .
 Out .
 No r no scroll-wheel . Okay . Um I don't see anything missing really .
 Yeah , we should too bad we don't have the finance . We could've
 Do you have all your answers ? Okay .
 I have all my answers , yes .
 Yeah , it's I'm not sure if we're if we're gonna get finance anyway because I thought we cou I thought it was gonna be an issue at the first time we started . I thought it was gonna be a cost issue which material we were gonna take relative to the advanced chips or anything . So you just do whatever you like and uh doesn't care what it costs .
 I have to call this in a form .
 Hmm .
 Hmm .
 Hmm . There is I have one question .
 Hmm .
 Hmm .
 I only have one question with the material , but I don't have information that . We've chosen rubber .
 I think we're rubber is not expensive . Definitely .
 No , but can we make yellow rubber ? I think so
 You can make rubber in any colour . In any colour . So I mean you can't make yellow titanium , but you can make yellow rubber .
 Yes , you can colour rubber , yeah .
 Ah .
 Okay .
 But we ha w we don't uh use our reco uh we uh removable cover ? No , huh ?
 Mm .
 Okay .
 Uh yeah we can make uh for example it's just something you can click on it like uh that's but it's not som not apparently that's not something we're working with in the basic design . So .
 Maybe maybe later , maybe we can uh
 Hmm .
 Yeah , it could be . It can be done , for e
