**********
 Yeah ? Everybody's ready ? Great . Well , welcome to the kick-off meeting . I uh forgot to put my name over here , it's uh it's Martin .
 Great . Thanks .
 Yeah .
 Uh , so you all know .
 Well , this is the agenda for today . Well , the opening is what I'm doing right now . Uh , we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things . Uh give some um
 examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing . We have twenty five minutes .
**********
 Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control . Uh , some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly .
 Mm-hmm .
 So now we all know what our
 Okay .
 goal is . Um , I oh forget I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other . We all know each other's names . Joost , Guido , Antek .
 Yes .
 What is your name ?
 Yes . Antek .
 Antek Ahmet . And Joost .
 Okay . I think we uh al already uh been through that part . Okay , it consists of uh three levels of design . Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting . You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions , and uh you p you probably read that already , so I don't have to tell you about that .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Yes .
 Yes .
**********
 Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . We have the smart-boards , uh the thes those two boards . This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . You can uh um there's a document folder called um the sh shared document folder . You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . We also have the white-board . Uh , we're gonna skip through th
 Can we see the white-board on our laptops ? No , I saw I saw the file , the smart-board that X_B_K_ but
 No , no . Just on the on the screen over there .
 Oh , no . Probably is , but I don't know if the software is on the laptop . Is is if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting , so I don't think it's I don't know if it's important .
 Okay .
 This an explanation of the smart-boards . There is a tool-bar over here .
 It's quite simple . You have the the pen function , eraser function . It's like a very simple uh paint application . Uh , we well , we use the same file during uh the whole day , and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . It works like this .
 Oh . If pen is selected , yes . Oh , no no .
 With that pen ?
 It's not
 But it is pen .
 It's not working like a pen yet .
 Mm .
 Huh .
 Huh .
 Mm .
 It's doing some stuff now . So you can use a pen . You can use an eraser .
 Little bit slower .
 And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks , and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format .
 And then select current colour or line width .
 So , it's quite easy .
 Uh well , now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools .
 Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths . Uh , I'll start off then . I'll use this uh same sheet . Alright .
 Oh , let me think .
 Different colours .
 Oh .
 Well , I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . Uh , a fish .
 piranha . Okay .
 Uh .
 Mm-hmm .
 Oh .
 I'm gonna use some different colour now . Some a little white .
 Looks like a fish .
 Think it is .
 Oh .
 Oh .
 Uh , colour .
 This is black ?
 I think so .
 Yellow
 Oh .
 Oh , this is just uh
 useless uh
 drawings but Oh teeth . I need teeth .
 Well , they're not supposed to be green , or whatever colour this is .
 Hmm .
 Okay .
 What was uh I have su to sum up its favourite characteris Well , I like its uh sharp razor sharp teeth . Plus , uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh , well a small actual face . And I like its overall uh aggressive look and
 Different .
 Well , that's what I like about uh piranha . I think that's kind of what uh the intention should be .
 Okay .
 Well , who wants to be next ?
 Nobody , I guess .
 I will try . Yeah . I will try . Uh
 You go , Guido ? Okay .
 Uh , make a new sheet . Uh , it's by pressing on blank . Yep .
 Blank ?
 Okay . Then pen again ?
 Yep .
 Okay .
 And uh so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths .
 Okay , um
 Format .
 control .
 Uh
 Ah , purple .
 Um , I don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is , but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird . Uh I will
 You know , I thought of that actually . Yeah .
 That's my bird . Yeah ? Isn't it quite it's a little bit light .
 Uh , another colour maybe . A red one .
 A small one . Uh , line width .
 Two ? Three . Oh that's okay .
 That's another one . Ano Uh uh it's a Yeah , it's uh the most simple uh animal I know , I think . Um , I don't know . Maybe because uh there's there's some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that . Maybe a little bit . Yeah . I don't know .
 Well , tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds .
 Its simplicity .
 Oh , okay . Okay .
 Okay .
 No , uh it's clear .
 So more uh birds ? Okay , okay , okay .
 N no no .
 We get your point . Okay . Who wants to be next ?
 Yeah , whatever . I'll go next . Thanks . I haven't got a favourite animal too , so
 M
 Pictionary .
 Oh . What should I draw ?
 A cow .
 Oh .
 Thank you , I'll draw a penguin .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 I'll draw a penguin . Whatever .
 I can't draw , so
 you can start to laugh already .
 I'll do so .
 Whatever . Something like that .
 Come on .
 Yeah , it's little bit hard .
 Mm hmm hmm , orange .
 Orange , of course .
 Whatever .
 Oh , it's better than your bird .
 Uh yeah . Yeah . True .
 Everything's better than your bird .
 Whatever . Hey , it's blue . No . Whatever . Um , I like its ugliness and uh Yeah , whatever . The way it walks or whatever . Your turn .
 Okay .
 'Kay .
 Drawing .
 I'm going to draw a cat .
 I don't know why , but a cat is a very uh smart animal .
 And you can have them at home .
 Which is not as the case with uh with bingwings and
 Well , you can have a piranha at home .
 Ye yes , yeah .
 Huh .
 Or a line .
 A little bit . Yeah .
 I mean a bird .
 Don't mess with my birds , yeah .
 It's not very uh
 very good drawn , but you can see a cat from it .
 Hmm . It's a handicapped cat .
 cat .
 I don't think uh I don't think uh Darwin would agree with that .
 It's
 Ah , it's not scared . He's crying but
 .
 He's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness .
 Okay .
 What do you like about it then ?
 Uh it's i most cats are small . You can handle them .
 Oh , okay . Okay . Okay . Okay , and then we are uh through the tool training , I guess .
 Okay .
 I wouldn't call it training , but
**********
 Okay , this is uh something about the project finance . The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . We're very ambitious on this one . The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . So that's clear . Yeah ?
 Okay .
 Alright .
 Okay , we're now gonna discuss some stuff when well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . Uh , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . Do you have uh know what good experiences with remote controls ? Or do they annoy you sometimes ? Are they difficult to understand , or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well ?
 Yes .
 Hmm .
 I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with
 Yeah , okay .
 Different .
 Okay .
 uh grouped buttons , you know . All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh
 Different functions of of uh
 Well , one area or whatever , not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um , yeah , to minimise it to this this or whatever o o other functions totally somewhere else . I think we should group them . And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? Uh
 Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 But uh , the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably . It's what , from my experience .
 Yeah .
 But isn't it
 I don't know . Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television .
 Okay .
 But we gonna
 It's only for television , I thought . Not
 Yes .
 Oh , it is only for televis
 I thought it was only for television . So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ .
 Yes , it is only for television , but uh
 So wha what
 Well
 What wha what uh what document
 well we we're gonna brainstorm about that . If we think it's useful , we do it .
 But , where where did it uh Where did you find that ?
 Uh , in the email . I thought it said uh Yeah , television remote control .
 Oh , okay .
 That's right . It's a television remote control . But I was thinking since it is useful with D_V_D_
 Yes ,
 Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . So we can No , we have to think about that . Okay , uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user-friendliness , is a is a pri priority in this case , or
 Yes , that's uh something extras .
 True . Yeah .
 True .
 Yep .
 Yeah , also no one's gonna buy it .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 I guess .
 Only the experts .
 True .
 Well , this the maybe is uh some aspect of the uh , or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful . That w Well , then you're you're the usability uh man , so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then .
 Yeah .
 Oh my God .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Okay . Well , other ideas ? How can we make it trendy or something ? Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it ?
 Uh , to go with to go with fashion and
 Maybe a can opener underneath it ? I don't know . Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh Oh , well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably .
 For the bear . Uh
 I I uh , no I think it
 Yeah , way too high .
 Uh , I th I think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market . It's international , so we have to use a standard .
 Yep .
 Well that's an idea of course , yeah .
 Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh Well , m has to be something spectacular or uh one which makes it
**********
 We gonna skip back to the goals probably . Uh ,
 Mm-hmm .
 original , trendly , and user-friendly Well , we al also already talked about user-friendliness . No , well something trendy and original , well that that goes hand in hand I guess . When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , or we should make it combination of that .
 Hmm .
 Yeah .
 'Kay , so you the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for , so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh , you know , you want to manage with it . Well , and that's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it .
 Use friendly .
 Yep .
 Well , and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy . Well , you know , y like some special feature . Or some Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something .
 Yeah .
 Yes , what the market wishes .
 Okay .
**********
 Well , the closing . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Individual , I think so . The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , we will uh
 Already s said that . The User Interface Designer is it a User Inter User Interface the technical functions design . And the Management Expert of uh the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi Well , this one was already clear to us . Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . I don't know how much time we have left . Oh , not many I guess . We started at twelve .
 Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Interface d

 He is the whatever .
 Yeah , close it .
 I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes .
 Okay .
 Yes .
 And uh it's it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations . You can all Or we're all uh
 Okay .
 Project joc project documents is for showing uh on the white-board . Yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah , but we're all familiar with uh uh Microsoft PowerPoint , are we ? Yeah , okay . I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down and then we're ready .
 Yes .
 Yeah .
 Alright .
 Okay .
 Or we can leave already I guess . or uh or sh or should we uh or is important that we leave at exact uh
