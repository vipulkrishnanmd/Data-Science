 Oh .
 It's not saved yet .
 Okay .
 So
 Okay .
 Our beautiful drawing .
 So just f um
 So this is our agenda . You're F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me .
 Oops .
 Okay .
 Uh I didn't Oh yeah .
 So these are the
 Oh , okay . Yeah .
 So these are the um last notes we I made . If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . I don't have to put it in the report .
**********
 Are we doing the the speech recognition ? Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well .
 Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . So if you want to , it's okay .
 Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in .
 Okay , just
 Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh
 Yeah , and Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? Or fold open ? I don't know .
 Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls .
 It's probably better .
 Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions .
 It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well .
 Maybe that's better .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , that's that's a very good point .
 Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside . So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it .
 Think that's better .
 Yeah .
 Okay . So this is okay ?
 No . Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then .
 Okay , so that's Uh I'll just have a look how much that is . But um Okay , for the Okay . No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So
 The
 Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah .
 Yeah , I I think so . I don't know .
 Okay .
 Ah okay .
 So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . So it's okay .
 Good .
**********
 So you can show your prototype if you want to .
 Yeah .
 Together ?
 Yeah , it's Let's do it together . Okay .
 I'll give comments .
 Yeah , we just made a Word file
 with the basic
 elements .
 Uh the look-and-feel model . Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . Simply a square with uh round corners . So that's basically it . Uh the material should be hard plastic .
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh colour changeable , and also transparent . And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know . Um then the elements .
 Uh we have
 The functions are just basic . Like uh I've pointed them here . Mute function , on-off function , text functions . This uh switch channel . And this is the
 Okay , cool .
 the num-pad . And the logo is over here , and the mic .
 Okay .
 And the scrollwheel , no ? You operate that with your pointing finger . So you hold it like this in your right hand and
 Means
 Mm .
 So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ?
 Speech recognition .
 Yeah , speech recognition . Just Only one button to say it's on or off .
 Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something . Um so I've
 Uh I dunno .
 Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it .
 Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore .
 So you can put it on the back as well if you want to .
 Yeah , you can put 'em all on the back . That's for sure .
 Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know . Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad .
 Okay .
 That's uh
 Okay .
 We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . But
 You have a lot of room if you can slide it open .
 Yeah , you can put it separate .
 You Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So But it's enough room .
 Yeah .
 Um the position ? Yeah , you write uh You wrote this , so .
 Uh well Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central .
 That was the the most important thing . So uh the best place , the best reach place Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find .
 Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's
 will uh will show up .
 Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know .
 Yeah . But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then .
 Yeah .
 Just just one thing now . Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes .
 Okay yeah , they
 Mm yeah .
 Yeah okay . That's that's below that then . It's uh twelve buttons .
 Yeah , okay .
 just so you get that .
 Okay , but
 It's rather important .
 Yeah .
 Yeah okay , just we just missed that . But um I'll just uh
 I'll get back to later . F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . So um should be popular .
 Um
 The f uh the buttons creating ? Uh if you
 That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners .
 Okay .
 So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling .
 Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons .
 Colour changeable . Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . We have decided uh in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it .
 Okay .
 And also in the num-pads , there's also colour light behind it .
 And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? How do you want to implement that ? Just on the Maybe on the second level as well ?
 So when you pre
 Yeah .
 We're going to implement . Yeah . Mm just a little
 Ah .
 Yeah , these are just basic functions , so All the non-basic are in
 Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Um
 Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player . That function must be
 Okay , maybe we use this button for the
 Yeah , maybe Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions .
 Yeah , I um To your video device .
 Yeah , as well . Just make make a Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something .
 Yeah .
 A second level ? Like a a new blank one or Or just here ? Okay .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 No no , just on Down there . So uh
 Is i Ah okay .
 Yeah .
 And h how does the second level come out ? Uh it slides uh along ?
 Just uh if you s
 Um slides I think . It's
 Yeah , y Maybe , yeah .
 From from the uh beneath ?
 For the bottom .
 You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough . If that breaks then you're screwed .
 No , you gotta slide it .
 Yeah , it's right .
 So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . Um
 So what do we need ?
 Uh i the the speech functions buttons .
 Yeah , just
 Menu ?
 Menu button .
 With uh maybe uh arrows .
 So you can uh
 scroll in the , navigate the menu .
 Um
 God damn it .
 Scart ?
 I think we can even put a We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels . So you have one left for the Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often .
 Uh yeah .
 And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left . Yes .
 So this is the
 Yeah . It's a f basic uh
 If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day .
 Yeah .
 Extern or something .
 You want to save that file as well ?
 The drawing ?
 That was it .
 So here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many .
 Uh
 Doesn't really matter . Just just uh
 I don't know the functions . Okay . What else ?
 It doesn't really matter . That's Yeah well we don't have any uh Hmm ? What else ? Uh menu buttons with arrows .
 What else ?
 Uh menu .
 Yeah , to navigate .
 Uh With arrows .
 S Just uh like Um I think it's best if we do .
 Mm where do we have
 Or there .
 Like a normal um
 Like on the normal uh Like this .
 Yeah , with in the middle um a menu button . Okay .
 The menu button , yes .
 Well we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . So you can't redesign it .
 Mm okay .
 Yeah .
 Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ?
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 Uh and and you can hold it , you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons .
 Yeah .
 Just press it once , the colour should uh switch . Press again , the colour switch again maybe ?
 okay .
 Or we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it . Just red , yel uh red , green and
 Okay , yeah . Th Yeah . If we have enough place , uh then we can do that .
 Yeah , okay .
 That's that's very easy , yeah .
 We can put those here .
 Colour buttons . And then we choose green , uh blue and red or Okay .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 Okay .
 Okay . That's uh Um
 So did we miss anything ?
 Yeah , maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume .
 It
 Some text uh buttons .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but
 I just uh The volume logo .
 No , ma on on o on the on the
 there's one there's one text button I
 Oh wh Here ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Just make it
 There's one text button I prefer . That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text . Do you do you Did you think of that ?
 Yeah , or th or the
 Yeah , we have that on the the text button .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then
 Uh why not ?
 Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well .
 Ex Yeah . Yeah .
 No Whoa
 Well w we thought of a text button . And if you press it again , you get the the the
 I think um Yeah , the three stages . Yes .
 The sta the state you
 Oh just three stages , you Yeah , that's okay .
 through view . Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off . So you can switch back from second to w first .
 Yeah .
 No , it doesn't have to turn it off .
 No . Just remember where it was . It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page . If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? But maybe it's not the way
 Just don't
 Yeah .
 Yes , that's to remember .
 Okay , okay .
 Yeah , but that's that's uh
 I dunno if
 That's a functionality for the television .
 Yeah , I think as well , but Uh yeah .
 Mm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about .
 Yeah mm nee uh No , if i uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on .
 Yeah , in thi the the remote control in the
 Okay .
 Yeah , but you have to search every time again . That's what what happening if you do it like that . But it's still the television that has to do that .
 Th i
 the chip .
 Yeah , that's true .
 Yeah , I dunno . Okay .
 So yeah . Um do we need to fix that or
 Mm most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages .
 No , that's what the television does .
 Yeah , those memory functions .
 But uh not not every every television , so
 Yeah . Was uh this logo for uh volume ? Okay .
 Okay , it's cool .
 Yeah , that's fine .
 So that's it ?
 Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ?
 Yeah , I I thought about one thing . Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ?
 Mm . No no Yeah . Just hard plastic . So
 Just like your telephone , hard plastic .
 Okay . Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are uh And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ?
 It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway .
 I think just on the buttons . If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space .
 Uh I think just um
 Well yeah . That's too much place .
 Yeah , but
 Okay , just leave it . Just leave it .
 I don't think the space is worth it .
 Yeah , and i
 I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons .
 The most time
 Yeah , with rubber buttons . Yeah , okay .
 Okay . Fine .
 Yeah ? Okay , cool .
**********
 Mm mm mm mm mm .
 Yeah , I don't know what this means . But I think we just evela evaluated this one .
 Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model . I d d d I don't think if it's right . That shall show it .
 Oh okay , you made some criteria . Okay , cool .
 Okay .
 You have some usability criteria or Okay .
 Mm-hmm . Uh no , uh all criterias we just argue about . Uh
 Oh .
 In the bottom .
 Yeah .
 Look-and-feel ?
 Evaluation crit
 No , evaluation is
 Yeah , evaluation presentation .
 It's not in .
 Uh d it doesn't matter um It only had two pages or something .
 Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market . The Italians uh , how they think about it . And
 The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . I made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our
 Okay .
 um model . And this These are all I I I found , or I wrote down . And um we have to discuss about , if we give it a one or a seven . Uh
 Okay .
 Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea . It quite beautiful . It's
 Yes . Yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something . And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff . The LEDs .
 Mm .
 We are actu We are the
 Flashy .
 Okay . Well I think we do If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think .
 Yes . And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ? The basic colours are black or green or yellow ? Or you haven't thought about
 But uh
 Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste .
 Hmm ?
 Um basic colours , um yeah . Well you didn't say . Maybe um company colours ?
 Ho how do we make uh
 It's black .
 Black and yellow . Can
 Black .
 Yeah , yellow light . Do we have yellow light ? No , not really , but it's possible . It's
 A bit a bit of yellow .
 Not not not yellow , but just a bit of light yellow .
 Black white , maybe ?
 Like white , also ni or uh always nice .
 And what colours should the buttons be ?
 Uh
 Because um
 Yeah , different colours . This is
 Just um
 Oh , the same as th th the cover . But also th the light behind it .
 But can you change those too , with uh the switch ?
 Yes .
 No , no . Make them No , just make them black or grey or something .
 Yeah , grey . Just dark grey I think .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Okay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ? Beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours .
 Well we have changeable fronts , so
 Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful .
 So
 Yeah , just give it a one . It's okay . It's perfect . I think it's just what you want . Or not ?
 Yeah .
 It's hard to decide for us , but yeah .
 Yeah . It's ju so subjective .
 It it's At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls .
 Yeah .
 Okay , just give it a two .
 A two . Okay .
 The fancy look-and-feel . That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons . Okay . And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think . So
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 One more thing . Are w are we changing uh Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ? Or n no back light ? Yeah ?
 Slide panel ?
 Mm . Not needed .
 No . No , it's only on the number , behind the numbers and uh
 Yeah , not needed I think .
 And and the switch channel is uh There is a back light too ?
 Oh , you mean th this here ?
 That as well , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but that's unnecessary .
 What do I think is necessary necessary item ?
 It's pretty cool . If you slide it open , it lights up . That's that's really fancy , but I don't know if it's reachable .
 Yeah .
 Of course it's reachable .
 It doesn't make
 Then we do it .
 Hmm .
 Okay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up . So you can see what's really there . Not just not re on the buttons or something . Just a green light or some blue light .
 No . Yeah .
 To light it all up .
 Yeah , but
 But Yeah . Mayb Okay .
 Yeah , just backlight . Not not the buttons . And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . So the buttons are just grey .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Well yeah . Uh semi-transparent .
 Yeah , just only Yeah , that's right .
 Okay .
 Okay , fine . So I I think it's very fancy . So I'll give it a
 So
 Yeah , that's how I think .
 Yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so
 Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so
 Ye
 Yeah , this It is a one . It's okay . It's cool .
 Yeah .
 I think it's one .
 Okay , next . Learnable ? Easy to use ?
 This is a difficult one , because we we don't Yeah , we don't know it about the
 Yeah , we shall test it But uh
 Uh it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use . It's That's
 Yeah .
 No , but you don't have to use that . And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer . That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it .
 Yeah .
 No .
 So I think it's easy to use , but And learnable is a bit
 Learnable ? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control . Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel . I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or Uh then the re
 Well , I think it is .
 Well y just uh f
 But the rest of it is very easy , because there are so so n
 Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does .
 So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function .
 Yes .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn .
 So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use . And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device .
 Okay .
 But
 It's Yeah it's
 Yeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ? And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . You must slide it .
 Device .
 And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls . 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use . Because easy to use comes after learnable . I I think it a three or something .
 But yeah .
 Okay .
 Okay , just Easy to use is very cool , so just give it a two .
 Maybe three then . Learnable's
 No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah .
 Mm uh .
 The normal . And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know
 Yeah okay . Yeah .
 Yep , true .
 Then a two .
 Oh . Okay .
 New features . Techno technological innovative ?
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 The speech function and the colour . Colour .
 The speech function is new . The scrollwheel and the slide . Uh I think the slide is pretty new .
 And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide .
 Slide is not n is is not new . No . I already have a
 Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control .
 Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it . So that's not new . Yeah .
 Okay .
 But also slide that buttons come out , as well ? Okay .
 Okay , and the the the lightning ? Is that new ? The lighting's new . Scrollwheel . Speech ?
 That's cool . Yeah for a Uh for a f
 Mm it's pretty new , I think .
 Yes .
 Speech is new .
 Different colours , so
 Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 So we have a pretty new uh
 There are no games on it , that's that's It's not a one , it's a two again . But
 That would And we didn't uh
 It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something .
 But then we also have the the home station . We are forgetting about that now , but
 If you have
 Yeah . Oh yeah , that's right . Rechargeable .
 Uh-oh .
 Home-station .
 We don't recharge .
 Yeah , we didn't draw that too , but
 But that's more like uh now .
 Yeah , just draw it afterwards .
 Yeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing .
 I don't know .
 If you Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? In the the project uh map ?
 Uh
 Just save , save as ?
 Yeah . Mm-hmm .
 Uh save as ? No , that's not in the project .
 Well it's a already in the folder . L like number seven .
 Oh yeah , okay . Smart board . Yeah , but this one .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 This one is not yet in the Oh oh .
 I think it is .
 Yeah , it is .
 No , I think it is .
 Uh untitled ? Yeah , it doesn't matter . Save .
 Okay .
 Uh all the the seven , uh all the seven .
 But you still have to draw the resi the recharger . Okay . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . But not
 No , we are not extraordinary new or something . Tha tha that
 No , just so it's still a two .
 Mm two , I think .
 N
 Targeted audience . Uh we are the targeted audience ? Do we like it ?
 No , we we we searched for uh um a young group , audience , beneath f forty . Yes .
 Yeah , but l younger than forty . So we we are exactly the targeted group .
 Yeah , but did we reach , um with our uh style , the targeted audience ? Th that's my question .
 I think so , yeah . You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people . So you want
 Yeah .
 We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . So
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh That's that's That's this question .
 think that's a two or a one .
 Yeah , but s it That's basically not not handy . And I don't thi I don't see
 Yeah , this . So we targeted it ?
 Yeah .
 But we didn't follow the latest trends .
 Yeah .
 No .
 Yeah , you could make a a front
 Mm . I think we followed the latest trends .
 a front that's that's like uh like a banana , or something .
 Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh get on my computer .
 Oh right . Well uh fruit and vegetables , yeah . You can different front uh
 Yeah , you get different colours .
 Uh yeah , th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh
 So
 Like a a f banana kind of front .
 Oh yeah . But spongy will never be .
 No .
 So we give ourself a three or something .
 Yeah .
 Oh .
 Okay .
 So that's eleven .
 That's uh
 What's the average ?
 It's Yeah , it is one point eight three .
 Eleven divided by six .
 A perfect score . No , I don't know .
 We're not too hard on ourselves .
**********
 This is a a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up .
 Okay .
 And and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep .
 Okay .
 To call . Um
 Oh yeah , that's still
 Call
 Yeah , but uh we have to make a speaker then too . If you want to make it beep .
 Yeah , maybe we have to skip that one .
 Okay .
 That's Yeah , but it
 No no , I want that in .
 But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo .
 No , we need that . That's usable . That's really usable .
 If you do uh
 Okay .
 Yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , right ?
 Yeah , okay .
 It's uh
**********
 So I just got a financial um
 Yes uh .
 You s saved it or
 Yeah .
 I did save it .
 No .
 Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . If I forgot anything , just say it to me .
 It just is a battery . Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . But okay . So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros .
 Mm okay .
 That's fine .
 But uh is uh uh
 So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker .
 Okay .
 So that's both .
 Come on , it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three .
 Yeah , and single curved curved .
 But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or
 No , that's not on the list . But that shouldn't be .
 Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ?
 Yeah , we can uh
 Probably . I just The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was I'm not sure .
 Um different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah .
 See it's I think it's okay like this .
 Special form , yeah .
 It's hard to say . But maybe we have to um Yeah , okay . Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . We get different ones , that's all .
 Yeah .
 So you can put a recharger in it as well . But this is expensive , the sample speaker .
 Yeah .
 This ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah , it's four .
 Four . It's four Euros .
 Oh , them . Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or Okay , then we then we need to use it .
 Yeah . So we are
 Yeah , that's included .
 It's kind of weird that we we get this information now , afterwards . Because
 Yeah , no . Okay , so this is uh pretty much it this .
 Yeah .
 Damn , solar cells are uh expensive .
 So I just want you Yeah , we just made it .
**********
 So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh
 for everything together .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 We can do some discussion about this . Was there room for creativity ?
 Sure .
 Yes .
 Okay .
 Paul , was there room for crea creativity ?
 Beautiful .
 Mm uh i Yeah , I think so . I think uh everyone uh already . So
 Yeah m If we got a high mark for um
 uh innovativeness or innovativity
 Yeah .
 Or a different style .
 then there we probably have been creative .
 I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . So
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 We could make a lot of different uh remote controls . So it's creativity .
 Yeah .
 Huh .
 Okay , so the leadership
 Was there a leadership and
 Of course there was .
 Okay .
 What do you have to say about that ?
 No , I think Yeah .
 Who was the leader ?
 I dunno .
 Just normal discussion , I think . Not
 Yeah .
 one leader or something .
 One leader to
 check the time , etcetera .
 Yeah . And make notes .
 Yeah , I know .
 So more like a secretary .
 Yeah .
 Okay , next one . Uh team work um The the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard . We were not all We were not um agree with every not agree with . We're not finished .
 Yeah yeah . We were not finished .
 Yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just
 Uh .
 Uh I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time . I think that was the m biggest problem . Like uh the prices . If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , th that's weird .
 Yeah , because
 the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now . And then
 Yeah , and if you had uh fifteen Euros , then we would it . We had to
 Yeah .
 Hmm hmm yeah .
 Yeah , finance .
 So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right .
 Yeah .
 But the teamwork was okay .
 Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . And uh
 I think uh everyone listen to each other . Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 'Kay .
