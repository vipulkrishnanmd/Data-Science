 Here we go again .
 My mouse is not working anymore . He's uh when I put it in , is is going to beep beep beep .
 Oh .
 Oh .
 Okay .
 Oh , I got a nice little screen here over here .
 I got like this big black border uh on every side .
 Okay .
 Mm , okay .
 I'll I'll fix it . Yeah , whatever .
**********
 Everybody ready ?
 Yeah , it's okay .
 Welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by Maarten .
 Uh this is the agenda , the opening . Uh , we've got three presentations . And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me . And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions . We have uh forty minutes .
 Yes .
 Oh , well this is the the closing already . So uh well we start off with the th the first presentation then .
 Uh , I think um in uh we have to do it in uh in right order . Maybe the
 Okay .
 I don't know what the right order is . So
 Well , it
 No .
 Huh .
 Oh that . It won't doesn't Maybe we should start with the the technical functions .
**********
 Okay , how can I get this on the whiteboard ?
 Yeah ?
 Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder . You've already done that ?
 In project .
 Okay , I've done that .
 No can that open .
 Yes .
 Well let's close this one . We'll just uh open a new one .
 Open it there .
 Uh , well . Yes .
 Uh-oh . New thing .
 Oh yeah , uh I have to say something . Uh , due to some uh technical problems I haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes . But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay .
 About the get
 And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too .
**********
 'Kay , we're going to um
 uh talk about working design .
 Um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy , it activates a chip uh in the remote . It's an electrical circuit
 which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television .
 Mm , it's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology .
 Um , the known technology can make a cost very low . Uh , it's a wild uh a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . And and the components are very uh very cheap . Um ,
 Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available . Uh , again , it's a fair price . It's a common uh technology uh , like I told um Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh
 um part of the remote control . Uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , it's it is uh
 can be made as fast as printing paper . It's uh it's all very uh
 Okay .
 Yeah , they're making it uh all the time . Uh ,
 Okay .
 and it's not uh very specialised uh technology .
 I haven't come to here , but
 um I've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls . They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh
 just a remote control like everyone knows . So I don't know uh why I should put it here .
 Uh
 Okay . But it's the technical side of the remote control .
 Yes , but uh I uh haven't made it because uh of the time . But
 Oh .
 Okay . Well , we'll we'll have to skip that part then .
 What ?
 Okay .
 But you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control ? It's gonna be easy ?
 No .
 Yes .
 Okay .
 But nothing restricted for user interface ?
 Yeah . M
 With technical
 Um , no , it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology , yeah .
 I don't know .
 Okay .
 'Kay .
 Remote control is nothing special nowadays .
 R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . Doesn't really matter .
 Okay .
 Um
 But I kind of uh
 I don't think so , because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions , but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ?
 Okay . Yeah , okay .
 Yes .
 Uh
 Okay .
 Well , we'll see . We'll see later on .
**********
 Well , the technical functions . Um , well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got , but uh I got these two , and I think they're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user .
 No .
 No .
 th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements , I don't s uh know who's doing t
 Well , uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ? The ones I I've uh received from the account manager . Yeah .
 Yeah , but it I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control .
 Well , we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on .
 Yeah , well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it .
 Uh-huh .
 Okay , but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote . we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v Yeah ? Well , what that's what you want trying to say .
 Yes , I agree . Yeah .
 Well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user . But I don't know . It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Yeah , well some of these Uh , yeah .
 Well , some of that will Yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements .
 Yeah , probably , yeah .
 Yes .
 So
 Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . I think that's just basic what we need . And from that on we can user requirements what we need more .
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh
 Yeah , I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets , and I don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that .
 Yes .
 I haven't really found a conclusion like that .
 M you can just you can k you can keep it in mind that . I don't know . Uh , I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh yeah , more trendier design , I think . I think .
 Yeah .
 Design .
 Sounds interesting .
 Yeah ?
 Uh , well , that's all I have to say , I think .
 Okay .
 Yeah , that was it .
 Alright .
**********
 Well , then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market .
 Yes .
 .
 Yeah . It's alright . Um
 Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements . Um yes .
 The working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh
 how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . Uh , I've lined them up here . Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . I uh have found some interesting things . We do we do got a market . Um , three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach .
 Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . That's quite a lot . Um ,
 relevant options are , of course , power buttons . Although , only used once per hour . Uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . Furthermore , fifty percent says
 uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . That doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off . But
 it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . And um an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls .
 So , what I was thinking oh , wrong side . We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . Group features for a higher usability , uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used ,
 we could group them uh on one button
 and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh yeah , how do you say ,
 we can spare at buttons over there . And um , if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options , group them in the button , not too uh
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Small buttons , so they won't be very um , how do you say
 Visually presents .
 Yes , won't be very present , thank you . And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent .
 That was kind of what I found .
**********
 Okay . Well , then we I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important . Uh , well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , I think .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Yes .
 Because um
 uh s decided to put They have decide to put two additional requirements forward .
 Well , now I see four . That's kinda strange .
 Two ?
 Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . It's impossible , I think . So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or You know , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . So we have to think of that . The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely .
 Well
 No uh , I agree , I agree .
 No way .
 Not too much , no .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 I don't know . I think that uh
 that's what they're trying to say . Uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . But , well , they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger
 Mm-hmm .
 I don't really agree actually , to be honest . It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . It's only like thirty percent of the total market . Mayb yeah ?
 Yeah , but it is it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that . Our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , you know , a new customer group . That's the one we haven't covered yet . So I think that's
 what the problem is . We haven't got remote controls for uh Well I think , yeah .
 Okay .
 Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit . Not too much then , bu alright .
 Yeah , I think so . Maybe if it's no no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . So maybe we can
 make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either . Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . Okay , something else nice to know .
 Yes .
 But what's our slogan ?
 Sorry ? Yeah , you will have to look that up .
 The slogan uh
 Yeah , I'll have a look .
 We put the fashion in electronics .
 I think it's something about the Oh , okay . I thought it w might be , let's make things better or something , but
 Puts fashion in electronics .
 Sense simplicity .
 Sense and simplicity .
**********
 Okay well , let's go back to the
 the agenda .
 So we've now had to the three presentations . We know about the new project requirements .
 That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . Well , if I can uh make a start , I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be , and I already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . I think we're we're looking for some Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . Y well , that
 Yeah .
 Well , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that's not very uh yeah , we don't really need to have a simple remote control . I think we can implement more functions then , because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be a more
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but wha
 Yeah , yeah . M yeah , that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , I think they are are c are contradicting each other , because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_ , but they s do aim at a younger Well , ma
 But
 Yes .
 Yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used . So why should j we put this function in ? I think more I think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions .
 Yeah .
 Well , I think
 But I think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have
 Y
 Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player . You can uh , know , you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . We don't want that . I think that was that became clear . We don't want . But w maybe we should put some func uh , I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to ,
 Yes .
 you know , they want to uh
 Yeah , control .
 Yeah , but uh you said Yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making .
 control , remotely .
 No , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the The new project requirements told us not to But maybe w Yeah . I think we maybe should
 It's n
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it . But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind , or n what d what do you guys think ?
 But you can put them under the same button .
 Not much more than that .
 Yep .
 Yeah , if as far as possible .
 Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever .
 So t
 But what do you think ? Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices ? No , you don't think so ? Yeah , the new requirements say so .
 No .
 No , new requirements say no .
 So
 But you can put a play and stop and and rewind .
 Well , maybe it's maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control . You know , a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but
 Yes , but we
 Y yes .
 I i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control , they use their own th th with lot more functions .
 Yep , exactly .
 That's that's wha
 But but for for example , V_C_R_ , that's better example in this case . I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever , just play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward .
 No no , you don't No no , you don't need it . No , no .
 No , no . Exactly .
 Huh .
 Okay , but we have to think uh w we have to think D_V_D_ I th uh , I guess , so um but uh from my experience it's kinda a lot of D_V_D_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . Uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . It's c sometimes a bit difficult . Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh Well , I was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then .
 Yeah , I know , but uh
 Mm , yeah .
 Yes .
 Yeah , but just
 keep it simple and look more at th
 And uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . If you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote . Okay . It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table , and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more .
 No .
 It's only for television . So
 Yes , but there are there are
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , nothing more . Exactly .
 Okay .
 Alright .
 Um , but what televis
 But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? There are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have
 Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy . And simple . Well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . So we should put uh zap buttons on it . Um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels .
 Yeah . The user interface is easy .
 And the basic yeah , basic functions , yeah .
 Yes , definitely , yeah .
 Uh ,
 It's too much integrated in the other .
 Okay , a t a teletext button should be there . But just one big teletext button , on and off .
 Yeah .
 Probably .
 Yeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not nothing more than that . I think stop function is very useful . If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader ,
 Oh , okay .
 then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up , but
 Yeah , but uh I think that becomes too difficult , it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then .
 Well , I use it very regularly , the action . I re I use it quite often .
 Yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And
 Will you look
 we have to well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated . We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . Yeah . I don't know . I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote . I don't know what you th guys think .
 Look at the market .
 Well
 Might be . Might be .
 Yeah , I uh , it's Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah , for the soccer uh
 Yeah , but do you like to have a such a s stop button ? Or do you think it uh
 I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function .
 Well , uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um , a couple of weeks ago I looked at the for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th
 Yeah .
 Okay , it goes Yeah , but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . That's why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements .
 Yes , but you could put
 Yeah , but
 on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages . If you have seven pages , you can go up and down .
 Well yeah uh , lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using I think we should just put one teletext button on it . Then we meet uh the new requirements .
 Yes .
 True .
 we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design , I guess .
 A simple yeah .
 Okay . Um , well , what functions do we have to decide on ?
 Or do we uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want .
 We have the zap and uh the volume . Should we do m make them very big ? The the the zap button . D d
 I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present , yep .
 Yes .
 Th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also .
 But trendy , yeah . I don't know .
 Or maybe you should place them on a uh , in a special way ?
 Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick .
 Yeah , something or uh somethin special way to to zap through the it has to s it has to be yeah , and quick . You have to use it very quickly .
 Original . It was uh
 Yep .
 If you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus .
 True .
 Yeah , and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace .
 Yes .
 Oh , what should we decide on then ?
 I think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already , but it w shouldn't be a problem then .
 But
 Yeah .
 No , it's o just signals uh and the television d uh does the rest .
 Yep .
 Maybe uh
 No , okay , but we don't have to uh , when we don't want to uh control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple .
 No .
 Uh maybe we uh uh the batteries maybe . If you use large batteries or small batter batteries .
 The most standard batteries .
 I think
 I think that we should use uh d yeah , not not uh the b the watch kind th the most uh Well , it has to be simple , and I wi
 I think double A_ .
 Yeah ?
 Yep .
 Yeah .
 The most ordinary uh batteries .
 Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , you know .
 Okay .
 Yep .
 Oh . How much time do we ha we have left uh ? M m m more than thirty minutes ? Uh ten twenty minutes . Well , uh these these shouldn't
 I think about twenty minutes .
 But i in a way we have to be uh uh special .
 Early break .
 Yeah . Yeah , okay . But that's that's
 Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can what the extra touch can be . Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or Well , it was something about how we lose them . Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing .
 Maybe th m
 I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh ten to twelve or whatever .
 To find him . That's maybe yeah .
 Yeah .
 I don't know . I don't know . Nah , um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things . It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone , and it is i has something nice . Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it , or maybe it should or an or the like the the can opener . Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control . I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special . It's gonna cost twenty five Euros .
 Yeah , yeah , that's good one , yep .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination .
 Yeah , but the well , it's already been done .
 Yeah , but that's yeah .
 Nah . Yeah , that's true . But and I think it's gonna be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . it has to be used something special , and you really it has to , you know y not s people , when they buy it , they have to think , well this one lasts for a long time . We're really gonna use them . Not some thing you you throw away next week , you know .
 Yes .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 No , that's true .
 So maybe uh that's i I think that's when uh when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , uh it's very important to find something like this . So there's a very important task for you . And maybe we can all think about it . Uh , also for you maybe , when t you it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well , you know . So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing .
 Be original , yeah .
 Mm-hmm . And use friendly , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Must brain-storm .
 Uh-huh .
 Yeah , a swapable front or whatever .
 Yeah , or just different colours would be uh I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control . It could be be Yeah , you never know , but
 Well
 For the remote control .
 Why not ?
 Yeah .
 More money for us .
 But it and I think we have to make it quite big .
 Yeah .
 Quite big . Yeah , you think ?
 Yes , definitely , definitely .
 Yeah , people
 That's to be uh a formed for your hand .
 So , and and also because uh it is expensive . If you want it to be something , you know , it's ha doesn't have much functions want to be you don't want to get it l make it
 Yes , it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room . As I uh as I said during my presentation , fifty percent uh o
 Mm-hmm .
 And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . I I think you m might wanna put it uh yeah , that it it it it stands up . Yeah , you have to put it on its So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table . no no , put stuff inside it . But , it's like like a statue or something
 A standard or something .
 Yeah .
 A face ? Or uh yeah , yeah . Yeah .
 More like a joystick then .
 Yeah , yeah , I see what you mean , yep .
 It's like you have uh four phones . Something like that .
 Yeah yeah , but yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in
 If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros . I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . That's probably stupid , but uh as I found here uh , fifty percent , was it fifty ? Uh fifty percent
 That it's it's fashionable .
 I I don't
 Oh , yeah .
 But that's that's fun for the first time , and then the second
 fifty percent often loses remote control .
 Yeah , but but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it
 No uh , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in .
 Oh , okay .
 On the television .
 Oh , like this .
 Uh , that's kind of nice .
 If an a button in in that uh
 Or you can
 And then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable .
 A char chargeable . Yeah .
 Yeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah . Why not .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , that w yeah , but yeah , the pro No , well I think that it might be t p Well , nee but we don't Yeah . Maybe you , but we don't know much about production cost , but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , rechargeable units .
 Why not .
 With recharger .
 It should only cost twelve and a half Euros , of course . Aye ?
 Yeah , but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and So , it's not gonna be that expen
 Production .
 Yeah , okay .
 It should be possible . I think it's a good idea .
 Uh I I think it's a great idea .
 Yeah .
 S some kind of be I've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays .
 To make a base or something ?
 Yes . Yes , definitely . Yeah .
 Yes , but is that handy ?
 Well , I well it's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . That's one . And uh you can always find your remote control up
 It's it's it's it's
 But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries .
 it's not the purpose to be handy , it's
 Uh , okay . Well , maybe yeah , you could when that's when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , but you will you do need uh also an uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . Does it makes it kinda
 And then you
 Yes . Or
 Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course . I don't know .
 Mm . Yeah , but that's not it's ugly , I think .
 Yeah , yeah . Okay . Yeah .
 Yeah , but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it .
 No .
 On the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay . I mean , it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it , but um I think the bay is definitely uh
 Yeah .
 I think it's a good idea . And make it , you know , we we um
 Well , we uh it's it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control . We can save on the on the functions . We just put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up , it's also nice . And if you put it away , I think it's uh w we have to we uh that's uh it's not a easy market . We have to something special . And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control , and we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions , because we aren't gonna put
 Sure , why not . Yep .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 True .
 Yeah .
 Definitely .
 With eye candy , ear candy , whatever . Yeah , definitely .
 Yeah . And then uh when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing .
 Yeah . I think I think it's a good idea .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , it must be must be a gadget to have .
 Yeah . Oh , if it let's well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing . And the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . If that's too expensive , we won't do that . But it would be nice .
 Definitely , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , we c
 It would be nice , yes .
 It's the idea . I know that batteries last long nowadays . And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty . And you know then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo I've experienced that that
 Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so yes .
 Yeah , okay .
 So , easy functions . Well , we will we will I think we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi
 Or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down .
 Yeah , why not .
 Yeah . But it's also annoying . 'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it . Then it beeps all the time and . You don't want to have ever have those problems , and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable . And you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it . Uh , i i in the in the ma Yeah , but it w I mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that's a great idea , I'm gonna use it . And when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , I'll never put him in the recharger , I think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . Then when they look get m I I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control , they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh , I think it's brilliant . Yeah , I've never it's so simple , but I've never seen it .
 Hmm .
 Yeah .
 true .
 No , that's true .
 Why not .
 But you pay for it .
 Yeah .
 Bleep bleep bleep , oh there it is , yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 No . Nearly .
 And you can leave it just there .
 M maybe we should really do this . Okay now , well , how much time have we got left ? These clocks aren't uh synched . Oh , now I've put uh well , it is twenty p Okay , so we have ten minutes or something ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yes .
 Yeah , I'll
 Something like that , yeah .
**********
 Yeah , but we're uh we're done . I think .
 Uh fifteen minutes .
 We've decided on the functions . Well , there is some oh .
 There is a closing sheet .
 We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work .
 Oh .
 Oh okay , I'll make sure I'll I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes , the the s the next minutes won't be a problem , but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , but maybe it won't work , but you'll see . I think these are more important than the first ones , so
 We'll see .
 Can you make an uh uh
 a part of f folder for the minutes maybe ? That not not everything in one one uh folder .
 .
 Maarten , five minutes .
 Oh , five minutes . Yeah , because uh I I d I did uh the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy , you know . Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout , which I could uh , know , use for the other ones well , but uh I d think uh I forgot to do put done under the first one , and when you go write a second uh it's get it's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something . And then you you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know . Becau I d uh , it was not my uh pen .
 Yeah .
 Maybe .
 No , that's true uh , yeah .
**********
 Should we by the way draw um
 this kind of looks you like .
 on our nice whiteboard , um a little uh idea of yeah .
 Of the shape .
 Or the sh
 Yeah , probably , it would be nice .
 I dunno . Has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? I don't , for one .
 Do you get an idea of the shape ?
 Maybe like this pen .
 A bit bigger I guess , but
 No , bigger .
 A little bit bigger , yeah but
 The shape is nice , it's um
 something different , and we want we want that . Yeah .
 It has to feel nice in your hand .
 Well , I I I have to say , I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all , or I think some maybe we should no , that will be too costly . We shou we could also , that was a would also be an idea , but I don't think it I don't know if it exists already , you should like make Alessi or something design it .
 Oh , uh look uh look at the pictures .
 Okay , yeah .
 That would also be nice .
 But that's gonna then you c then you don't
 Yeah , but twelve and a half Euros ? Uh
 Yeah , but then you don't have t yeah it that's not something i that's in the production cost a one it's a one time , you know s was it's a single cost . Yeah , m but but then you can nah , I don't thin I think that it would be more expensive , because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , that's true .
 Would be a nice idea though .
 I don't know . I think it uh has to be a r it has to have round forms or something .
 Like something like that or so or so
 Something like that is very ergonomic .
 And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . It's also round .
 So
 Put it in there uh wire on it .
 Yeah .
 Maybe uh , I don't know , some some lights , a big but well .
 Yeah , flash lights at the side . At the side , or something like that .
 Volume and programme , yeah .
 Yes , volume and programme should be there I guess , because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part .
 And some of the extra funct
 Some of the extra functions over here . Numbers .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , and the numbers on top , I guess .
 Yeah .
 And and lights ? How we're g well , maybe uh s a ring of no , no , you have to Maybe on the side of it .
 Maybe ro roun rounds uh uh l sorry .
 Yeah , side of it . Just two LEDs or something on the side . Yeah .
 Along the side uh strip of yeah .
 Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons .
 Yeah , but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote .
 Oh .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Well , theys have to be
 Well , uh probably at the side .
 You know look at the front , but
 Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Exactly . When you you see it from the side , then it would look just like that .
 Yeah , exactly , and then there is yeah .
 And then you have
 a strip of uh lights or something .
 Yeah , something like that , yeah .
 Okay , yeah .
 Well , uh I think it's nice , for one thing . maybe put something on top of it or , you know , like that's looks funny . I don't know .
 No . No .
 Or some bump . Maybe some Yeah ?
 I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then .
 Bumper or something .
 We'll have to think about it .
**********
 I think we're we're done .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yes , we are .
 We can save this one .
 Alright . Yes , I guess it's lunch time .
 Lunch break .
 Okay then .
 Mm mm .
 I don't know .
