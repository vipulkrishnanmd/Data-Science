 Mm .
 So , Hi Christa .
 So , uh now it's the Hi Sammy . It's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . So um , first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype . Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . Then , w we
 Yes .
 Yes .
 And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team . And that's all . Okay . So first , let's uh
 And chocolate ?
 Mm .
 see the prototype .
**********
 Yeah .
 Uh , here we have our prototype model .
 Okay . And you have some slides then ? Yeah . Mm .
 .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah . Yeah , we have also some slides .
 Yes , and place some slides .
 Okay . Uh so in which uh
 In
 Uh , participant three .
 Prototype .
 Yeah .
 Mm okay . Mm .
 Five .
 Uh , so
 Him .
 this is our
 remote control .
 It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model , and then we'll give some technical specifications . That's well , so that's that . Please , next slide .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 We analysed all the fruits and contacted NASA , and uh made some real good Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that . And um ,
 MASA ?
 Mm-hmm .
 s society will accept that . For sure .
 And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . S please , next slide .
 But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m
 the modern material we can p select .
 And it's practical .
 And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something .
 And as I said , it's perfect .
 .
 Okay .
 Please press it . Everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an
 Experience . Explanat
 Such a nice thing .
 See this .
 s such a r such a device . So you can touch it with your hands . Sure . Yes .
 Can I ? Ho-ho .
 You can
 What do you say ?
 N
 It says
 You must say it .
 Spongy .
 I will uh
 One day . He
 I'll buy it . If I if I need so . Hopefully my daughter will like it .
 Yeah .
 Okay . Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course . , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and
 Yes , of course . Of c course .
 Ah .
 That's all I wanted to say .
 Now it's technical specification by our
 Hmm .
 colleague .
 Hmm .
 So
 Oh , there is a button missing . Okay . It's in option .
 Yeah . This this is really flexible . You can add your buttons . Yeah . So function , mm
 Mm-hmm .
 So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . Then you ha you'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .
 And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you don't want you can just use normal button . And we have speech recognition . Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise . And it can also do the action .
 Mm-hmm .
 Hmm .
 And location finder . And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . You can just say , where is my remote control . Or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby . And then , it will say hi .
 Mm-hmm .
 Hey , babe . Bob . Hey Bob .
 Bobby . Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , hi , and then you can use it .
 Okay , that's good .
 Hmm . 'Kay .
 So , um our team is now fruits . Mainly strawberry . So , you can have And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches .
 Oh , these are strawberries .
 Are colourful . Yeah .
 Material , we want to stick to titanium .
 We will send , we want to
 Fruit smelling spongy titanium . I didn't know it exist , but that's great .
 Yeah , or s
 So , we want to have simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours .
 Ha .
 Ho-ho .
 You mean we can change the colour uh of th
 That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ?
 For the L_C_D_ .
 Yeah . Yeah okay , for the L_C_D_ .
 With titanium it's it is silver . Yeah .
 Tit titanium is
 Mm-mm .
 Uh , okay .
 Mm , yeah .
 We are still working on titanium . So , r we'll start with L_C_D_ .
 You can ask Bob . It's Tuesday .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , Bob , please . Tuesday colour .
 Hey , you know you're theme today .
 Yeah . Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood , or s
 Okay .
 Hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Black for Sunday .
 And you can have many colours on weekends . Or
 And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ?
 On the L_C_D_ ? Oh .
 Wh wh
 Huh ?
 Ah , these are like sensors .
 Of course . What do you think ? Strawberry sensors .
 Mm-hmm .
 That's location sensors .
 Very useful .
 Okay . Strawberries .
 So , after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for
 Ah .
 Lounge meeting .
 So , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know .
 Yeah , and we can just some strawberry first . Um
 Yeah .
 Okay . Mm-hmm .
 Alright . Good .
 Oops .
 S
 So , huh . Interesting . In interesting . Mm mm .
 Uh we'll see in the financial part if uh all gets into
 So , any specific questions for
 It makes sense .
 Yeah .
 Let's make a party first maybe .
 Yeah . Then we can discuss We can
 W
 Who is the five uh fifty millions we first make a party in ?
 So uh , this is
 Yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left .
 Mm-hmm . Okay . Uh , so
 What a design .
**********
 It's my turn . Mm-hmm . Let's see if this Yeah , if you meet
 Let's uh , yeah , let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium .
 Yeah .
 the evaluation criterion .
 Oops .
 Fudge .
 Yeah . So , evaluation please .
 So . You made a very nice prototype , and um , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our what we want to do , and things like that . So mm
 Uh , next slide , please .
 As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can .
 Yeah .
 To so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . And we're all l going to list all the criterion . I'm going to go to that next slide , and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ?
 Okay .
 Fancy .
 So these are the criterion uh I'm I thought were important . Of course , this can be discussed , but let's let's see , so let's vote . So we have fancy here and we have the scale
 Mm-hmm .
 from one to seven
 with four in the middle .
 So ,
 Huh .
 Yeah , what's is really
 what do you think , is it fancy ?
 Uh , it's really
 Uh , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy .
 It is very very fancy . Or have you ever seen something like that ?
 Oh . I am not the d the only one choosing , yeah . Uh what do you think ?
 Yeah , of course . What do you think ?
 Feel the weight .
 Is it
 The weight is later . Now we're We're on the fanciness now . I think it's quite fancy .
 Yeah . Oh .
 Really .
 Uh-huh .
 Okay .
 Yeah , yeah . We can give at least five or six , seven .
 It's uh
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah , so No it's it's one . Yeah , o one means it's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . So it's one or two . What do you think ? Two ? Okay . So here , two . Up . Then we have uh technology .
 It's in the other . Yeah .
 Oh , Oh . So Oh , okay .
 Mm .
 Yeah , okay . Oh , okay . So
 Two . Let's say two , yeah .
 M maybe two .
 Two . Two .
 Technology .
 Yeah . Um
 So , what about technology ? We have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based , we have L_C_D_ .
 And we have L_C_D_ .
 So you change colours .
 Change colour of t
 Change colour , I mean that's very
 Useful .
 Yeah , I think it's a
 Quite d I think it's a one for that , at least . At least a one , yeah .
 Yeah , yeah , yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah , yeah . It's silly .
 Yeah . Uh
 Mm-mm .
 Robustness , uh-huh .
 Uh , still we need to cha
 So let's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away . Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again ? Uh , maybe not the prototype . Let's try .
 Um
 The strawberries Oh .
 Yeah , it Maybe strawberry .
 Oh my god . Okay , we just lost one strawberry . So Not at all ?
 No . No . How can I say this . It's still it's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . A strawberry .
 Oh .
 Yeah , we can easily plug it .
 It is
 Yeah . Yeah .
 So it's not so bad . I um uh I would say three .
 Mm-mm .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Yeah . But it's too . It's um robust , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ?
 Useful ?
 Yeah ,
 Useful . Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? So I don't know .
 Two or three ? Two or three ? Two .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Two , maybe .
 These buttons are uh It not clear . But you have at least uh next produce .
 Oh , yeah , lets me try .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 What is uh next , please ?
 Yeah , channel . I this is volume control and channel changes . These are the main
 Uh , it depends on the Okay .
 And you can uh do di two sites ? Yeah .
 You
 Yeah . Yeah , and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option . So if you don't want
 Okay , also .
 So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly .
 Yeah , um yeah .
 You can , by using the
 Yeah .
 You can .
 Directly .
 You go you So , the basic mode Yeah . So that's simple . The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . With two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down . Or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down . And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this .
 You c push here the the yeah .
 Yeah .
 Oh , it's a jog dial , okay .
 Uh-huh .
 And channel .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 You can select .
 You select twenty , you select five . That's it .
 Okay .
 Yeah mm .
 It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? Don't you think so ? May not okay , we can go . That's uh You're right .
 No .
 Yeah , yeah , yeah . Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah .
 That's it's less uh Yeah . But it's it's nice , because people anyway don't go there . But
 Yeah , yeah . Yeah mm .
 So what do you think for it , usefulness ? Seems to be useful .
 So , d Yeah , we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So
 Let me understand well , because I'm not sure that's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button . Yeah , two
 so
 Both .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Up down or left right . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Up .
 Yeah . And which what is that ?
 That
 It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . Like , selecting the menus .
 This is jog wheel .
 Okay , okay . It's a kind Oh , okay okay .
 Yeah .
 Um , see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one .
 Cool .
 Oh oh okay , great .
 I would say then uh
 Now it's looks us useful . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay , two .
 So size and weight .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Is it the the the effective size and weight that the Is it uh real size , real weight ? Or Because it Size is going to be that , yeah ?
 Yeah , it's size al almost
 Yeah , because it is The weight will be bit lighter . We will s We use titanium . Yeah .
 Uh , and and
 Sure , without titanium alloy , it's going to be light .
 Mm-mm .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 It's going to be lighter , because this seems to be very heavy f I mean , for my daughter , for instance . Not sure if uh she can use it .
 Of course .
 Heavy . Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 But sides uh , the sides should be okay . . Yeah mm .
 So , should be okay .
 Up to three for that , because I'm haven't seen the weight so I must not uh Colour and shape .
 Mm-mm .
 Okay . Okay .
 Oh .
 Uh-oh .
 Well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ . But um , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case . It's a it's going to be titanium . Okay , okay . That's nice . I think it's good . Okay .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 The case is silver titanium , no ?
 Yeah , it's .
 Yeah .
 Let's imagine .
 Moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . Even if it is , you know , it's very rounded , but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 And what about the strawberries on the top ? I'm not convince . But maybe I'm not trendy . But , uh
 Yahoo .
 Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year . So
 Oh .
 Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah , but uh uh they're not useful . I I mean it that's uh
 So maybe , I think
 Uh , I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . Whether it's fancy or not now , it we have to decide . But this If it's
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 Yeah , well
 Yeah . Um
 Hmm .
 I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful .
 Uh-huh . So , that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead .
 Yeah .
 .
 Yeah , well then it's bit difficult to use . Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too . So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours . So it's Even
 Mm-hmm . But the n Yeah .
 Mm .
 So , it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh
 No , I'm not sure uh why uh if it was like this
 These buttons
 But it looks really not really good . I mean , the f Yeah . So these are kind of rubber things . Even if you lose one you can just put whatever . Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and
 I
 It's n no , it's not fancy any more .
 Okay .
 And
 Uh-huh . And different routes . Okay , I see what
 Okay , so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , we've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here , so we just Yeah , so even if you don't put , it works . But this is really fancy .
 Also .
 Okay .
 I suggested three . Because uh , everybody s doesn't seem to be convince , although it's quite You have good arguments . But
 Okay .
 Okay . Okay .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 And uh the last one is adaptive . This is not r maybe not as important as the other one , but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ?
 Yeah .
 Sure , sure , just look at it .
 Great . Fully adaptable . That's Yeah . So you can fit into your palm , okay . That What else can we need ? You Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well ?
 It's full adaptable .
 Wow , that's a
 Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know .
 Yea
 Yeah . You can Yeah .
 Yeah , it's fudge titanium . You know . Right , yeah . And uh
 It's fudge , yeah , yeah . Yeah , fruit titanium , yeah . Well , I if if this is if you are ready to do that , then I think it deserves a one .
 Mm ,
 Yeah .
 Okay . Let's go for one .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Now we have to do the average .
 Three , three , six , eight , eleven .
 Who is good in math ?
 It's two point one seven .
 Okay . Two point one seven . That's nice . Two point one seven out of seven . I think we have a good
 Hmm .
 .
 Yeah .
 good thing . Well , that's all I had to say about the evaluation . So
 So it's a good evaluation .
 It seems to be good , yeah . We have uh
 Yeah . Mm .
 Yeah mm . Yeah , two one one seven , we have . So
 Yeah .
 Mm-mm .
 Yeah . Okay . Thanks .
**********
 Okay . So now , it has to fulfil the financial criterium ?
 Financi
 Ah-ha .
 So , I have an Here . Um
 .
 Energy . Uh , we use bat
 So so how many batteries do we need ? One battery ?
 One battery . Yep .
 Okay , so two .
 Good .
 Why two ?
 Oh , we just need one , I guess .
 Say no . No , ne never install .
 Uh-huh .
 Two batteries or one ?
 Oh .
 No , number is one . We need only one battery .
 Only one .
 Yeah yeah , but the price is two . Oh , number . Sorry sorry sorry . I'm sorry .
 No , no . But no , no . No , no way .
 No , uh you just Number . Yeah .
 Number , number .
 Yeah . You never use uh Excel ? Good .
 Yeah . Yeah . Oh .
 No , never .
 How What what's the limit ?
 H
 It's twelve bucks .
 Uh , it's it's okay that I don't know , 'cause uh it's not my field . Twelve bucks . Okay , now Mm-hmm . Check that number also .
 Twelve bucks . Twelve and a half , I think .
 So we
 Okay .
 Okay , electronics . So
 We have sample chip . Uh , like simple chip , yeah . So , yeah . Yeah . Four buttons at least . And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition .
 It's a simple chip ? Simple chip , okay . One .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 And for the
 One also .
 One or two ? One ? Okay .
 Yeah , one to one . Yeah , one .
 So the case , which one uh is it in the end ?
 Yeah , I think we will go for a single curve , no ?
 Let's do a single curve .
 Oh , is
 It's it's flat .
 It's flat , and curved .
 Oh . Oh , okay .
 I thought you can curve somebody .
 It's flat .
 But it is flat , you Look . It's curvable , but it's not curved .
 It's curvable .
 Maybe there is a supplement for that , no ? It's only curve ? Okay , let's go .
 Mm-hmm . Oh see , I I think that the the price is this one .
 Yeah .
 This Okay , you d We tried , we tried .
 Yeah , yeah . Don't chip on me .
 Oh .
 Oh , okay .
 So , what is it ? T titanium ? Mm , that's expensive . Mm-hmm .
 Titanium .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm .
 Mm-mm .
 Mm .
 Yeah . But she wanted u the fudge titanium . I think it's five , but you don't say .
 Okay .
 Yeah , well
 Let's stick to s titan . Special colour ? No because uh
 Well , n Why three ? Why three ?
 No , only one , no ?
 Mm .
 Oh , sorry . Again , I'm See it .
 Yeah .
 Um
 Special colour , or it's only on the
 Interface .
 Oh .
 Yes , in L_C_D_ display . Ok
 Yeah , but there is no colour here . So I put it here .
 Yeah , an Yeah .
 Push-button .
 So the L_C_D_
 How many push-button ? Three or two ?
 Scro
 Uh , two .
 Two .
 Is there The scroll-wheel , okay .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 It's going to be expensive .
 One scroll wheel . One L_C_D_
 displayed .
 Okay .
 Um
 That's that's not We choose this one , and not this one .
 That's all ? No .
 Yeah .
 Oh , I think , no it's Uh , is it a scroll wheel and pe push button , th this centre one ? Or only only scroll wheel , okay .
 Yeah , it's cheaper .
 Or only a scroll-wheel .
 Yeah .
 Only scroll wheel . Yeah mm .
 So
 You are trying to make make up make us up .
 You try to s No , no , no . Because how do you do to y select ?
 It's already
 Ah .
 No , but you select with the two d the other two buttons , no ?
 Y ye
 Yeah , I mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you
 That's true .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Then it automatically we can just do like you feel , it goes . And it will activate Um , plus , yeah , it's price is really
 Yeah .
 Stay longer . Okay . Oops . Okay , okay . Um
 It should stay . Yeah .
 Special colours , yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 For buttons .
 Okay .
 Yeah , buttons and strawberries . Yeah .
 No , buttons just normal .
 Special form .
 You you have all of these , no ?
 She's very hard on this . Special colour ?
 Mm maybe n not this one but
 Yeah . No . Special material ?
 Uh , we have titan
 That's for buttons . But buttons are standard .
 Yeah , buttons are the standard buttons . Yeah . It's only buttons , these .
 Yeah , so
 Nothing special . Okay . So we are at seventeen dot eight .
 Yeah .
 Not special colours an interest in ?
 No , the colour is in the L_C_D_ .
 And buttons are not colourised ?
 They are m
 I no .
 Mm , hmm , I think uh because you can just go for a good colours . Yeah , and uh
 We can just use this red . It's
 Boo-hoo . It's already too expensive . Apparently .
 Yeah .
 So what is Are we supposed to cut things out now ? Uh , until we get twelve fifty .
 Yeah . Mm .
 Mm-hmm . Mm .
 Oh .
 So think of what we can cut uh here .
 Well ,
 if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_ and the speaker .
 Sample speaker . Yeah .
 Apparently , we have to choose one or the other .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Well , as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy .
 So , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy
 But you don't need a battery ? Mm .
 to make electricity . Yeah , that you don't need a battery . So , it's something like hand dynamo robot .
 Mm-hmm .
 A real high-tech version of it .
 So that would
 But um it's like the hand dynamo , no ?
 Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand
 So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , we only We we win one . That's already that . Okay , let's do that .
 is
 Okay , but l
 Yeah .
 Uh it's a it's a beginning . Okay .
 Yeah .
 Why not . Let's do that .
 So
 One here and here .
 Yeah , just remo
 'Kay .
 And I propose to So uh , about chips . Advanced chip on print , right ? So , put minus one there , please .
 S
 Mm-hmm .
 I'm not sure if this is legal .
 Mm . That's right .
 Yeah .
 Why not ?
 Uh , no .
 And ?
 And ?
 M maybe minus uh three , no ?
 No . Okay , let's see .
 Yeah .
 So , was there result ? Let's have a look .
 No , no . It's not
 Mm-hmm . Mm .
 It's not changing , no ? It you don't
 Yeah , yeah , yeah , if Click somewhere , you'll see features . Yes , it does .
 Why ?
 Oops .
 So Oh , sorry . Mm-hmm .
 Maybe put minus two , so it looks uh more reasonable .
 Yeah . Why not .
 Yeah , anyway No , minus two .
 Minus .
 Nobody will know . It's not recorded , is it ? Okay , we're on time . Good .
 Mm .
 Good .
 Okay .
 So now on , we can increase our Still you have two more . Maybe we can use it for our party .
 Oh , we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want . Oh . Both its it's cool .
 And a battery and a battery , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , yeah .
 No , now we are exp exceeding I think . It
 Now it's fancy , let's add one instead of two .
 Yeah , that
 Mm .
 Is it ?
 Yeah , yeah y
 I think we're exceeding now . We have to remove the
 No , but point five point three .
 Uh , it's better . I think they are counting uh We would prefer , yeah . Maximum is maximum . So , remove one of them . Yeah . Okay . Okay , we're uh on target .
 Okay .
 Yeah . Mm . It's maximum and don't have to Yeah , yeah . Uh
 Is really strict ? Oh .
 Oh yeah .
 Uh , mm-mm .
 Yeah . Mm . Okay . Mm . So target reached .
 I'm just curious to see this uh my address chip on print .
 What else ?
 Ho
 It's um English uh Yeah .
 Trick . Uh , I would say it's the Russian trick , but Anyway No , they may have some their origins , strange origins
 Yeah , but uh is uh English . So Mm .
 Oh . Uh
 Well , I don't know . I don't know .
 I am not sure who was programming this calculator , you know .
 'Cause uh
 I wonder if we put A_ or B_ somewhere instead of a number .
 No , no , no . Let's finish this meeting instead .
 Mm , let's try . Okay .
 And we can discuss all these things in our party .
 I save it uh
 Okay , so next mm
 No . This is right .
 No , that's yours . Sorry .
 Okay , so finance , that's done . Are the cost under twelve ? Yes . Project evaluation , good .
 'Kay .
 Mm yeah , very much .
**********
 Okay . So now
 Next slide .
 Project process .
 We have to make um
 Safe uh asse uh safe assessment .
 Yeah . Yeah . Mm . See mm how Are we a good team ? Mm .
 Yeah , I think we've listened to everybody . Everybody could say what they thought .
 Okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm .
 And uh
 Is there enough room for creativity ?
 Yeah , yeah .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Mm . And you .
 Yeah . When we see the results , there is no doubt there Maybe a lack of leadership ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah , it's really
 Mm . Oh . Okay . Well , project evaluation .
 Yeah .
 M maybe not , huh ?
 Team-work , very strong , I would say . Team-work , no problem .
 Yeah , our team-work is really strong .
 Means .
 Whiteboard , digital pens .
 Oh , we still , I guess .
 What was the Oh yeah , what was good ? Everything . What was bad ?
 Yeah , I think white-board is useful . Digital pens , useful .
 Hmm .
 New ideas found ?
 So , you say , is there sheep ?
 Yeah .
 Luck . Okay . So luck , but good . Which imply good uh team performance .
 But uh
 Yeah , but uh then I I mus
 Yeah . A good leader , you know , a good leader is somewhere in the shade and
 That's true . And there's uh one very important point . We're on time .
 Don't really .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Meetings finish when they have to or even before .
 And we also
 Mm . We made Mm .
 The for meeting it's uh one of the most important thing .
 Of course . Uh
 Okay . Mm .
 Not to waste time , that's important .
 Yeah . Yeah , we have other uh remote controls to create .
 Hmm .
 We need time f
 Okay .
**********
 Ah , we got new idea , speech recognition , location finding .
 A lot of uh
 New materials .
 Mm . .
 New materials , new s uh this fancy strawberry design .
 Yeah , uh new ways of doing financial
 Mm , yeah .
 Hey , just wondering if my uh what about the the pink the pinkness of that uh
 And new tricks .
 Mm .
 Mm . They're working on um pink titanium .
 . They are working on a Okay , good .
 Ah , very .
 I think we are great . There's no no other words for that .
