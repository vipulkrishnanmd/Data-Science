 Welcome back .
 Hello .
 Hello .
 Uh let me see .
 There's one of mine .
 Okay . Roo , welcome back .
 Hello , Flores .
 The waiting is for Sebastian .
 .
 There he is .
 Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? Can I get a cup of coffee ? Okay .
 We have a slight problem . I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys .
 Sorry ?
 Uh no . You can't , sorry .
 So just cancel it .
 Well , during my work I have no time either . So
 Well , this is life . Sorry uh , Roo .
 Yeah , I opened the C_D_ ROM box . Accidentally . But it's alright .
 Okay . Okay . People , welcome back with the second meeting .
 Um for now on the schedule are a few points . Uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now . Um second , I received um some new project requirements . I'm not sure if you received them as well , um but I will tell you about it . Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ?
 Mm-hmm .
 I think so too .
 Roo ?
 Yeah .
 Ruud ? Almost , okay . Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . Um the top goal of this m
 Almost .
 But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe .
 Um we will figure that out . Ca can you try to
 Okay .
 Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the .
 Yeah , w we will see .
 I don't think it's wireless here . Or it is . Yeah ? Okay , great .
 Um it is , yeah .
 It is . It is .
 Uh okay .
 Yeah . Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . Um
 we have forty minutes . So
 it's now
**********
 Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product .
 It's a board decision . Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w uh uh we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with . Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um
 Yeah .
 Time , yeah .
 then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product .
 Yes .
 Is that clear ?
 Any questions on these
 requirements ?
 No ?
 Okay .
**********
 Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ?
 Yeah , I'll start .
 Uh uh yeah . Okay , great .
 Yes .
 Um
 Oh , how can I uh
 Geez , and sli and show .
 Um
 Just uh press it . Uh yes .
 Alright .
 Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . Uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .
 So that was
 the main uh important thing what a remote control should do . Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion . And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Um but um yeah .
 My personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than less than forty years old . So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh
 Uh-huh .
 take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .
 Okay .
 Uh Ruud , did you get that ?
 Yeah , uh b uh most .
 Yeah .
 Okay , so the important thing here is
 And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic . Yeah , what what does the market want ? I I don't know .
 Oh , user-friendly .
 In the market , yeah .
 Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh
 Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .
 Yeah . Okay .
**********
 Sebastian .
 Okay .
 Excuse me .
 Scusi .
 Um
 Okay , it's still the right thing .
 Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here , but it's hardly readable .
 Energies and uh
 Can you see it ? No ? Well
 No , it's not visible .
 Yeah .
 The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Um , there's a energy source here . And um basically there it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that . It's almost every piece of equipment um
 every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w yes . In the and it's a little more a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here .
 So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment . There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before , and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . So
 So it's fairly easy .
 Succeed in it also .
 Okay .
 Okay , good .
 Yeah .
 Okay , so uh personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . So I think that uh should be clear . Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them .
 Okay .
 Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment . And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . I think our uh users will really uh will really like that .
 Okay .
 And what's the um if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or
 No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also . So we can use them . So that's no problem .
 Okay .
 For the same costs , it's can be uh in our
 Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making
 Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh
 We can we can make its I think .
 Well you could only lit uh the buttons the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess .
 Or
 Okay .
 But I think
 Hmm .
 Hmm , true .
 Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , and not for
 Yes . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . No no no , no . That's right , that's right . So well , this uh should be it .
 Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Um have a think about it .
**********
 Okay , Ruud .
 Oh , mine is already outdated .
 Okay well , we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product .
 Since uh
 So any income is welcome . Input .
 Okay , make
 Well
 Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units .
 Of of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .
 Could you step a little bit more to the right ? Yeah , thank you .
 Okay .
 But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea .
 Uh well , skip this .
 Yeah .
 Well , it's this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them .
 Mm .
 Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones . Or
 Okay .
 Well , that's interesting .
 Or a find a finding function , you know . That's quite a yes .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , that's definitely interesting . It uh it separates our product from others uh as well . Okay , go on .
 Sound signal .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yes .
 Well , I just said that . And uh well , this obvious , and he also said it .
 Okay . So that's what the market tells us .
 Uh that's about it , yes .
 Yep . Okay .
**********
 The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . So
 Uh mo uh zap buttons most . Volume , they are uh use a lot . But
 Yeah , well it should just have a design
 more than all the other buttons . So
 The perfect design for those only those buttons . And first um
 Yes .
 Yes , we should focus on that , I guess . Well , the technical uh there I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 Yeah , the sound signal . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? Another device is not a solution . It should be uh uh
 Yeah , that's uh a problem . Yeah .
 Well
 Yes . Th that's a bit of that's a problem . Usually
 Well maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , like um turning on and off the the the lights .
 Oh yes .
 Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it .
 Yes . Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep . And um
 Reports rep respend response to it .
 Yeah , just like uh the phones the
 Yes . Yes , that's it .
 Yes , same thing .
 Yeah .
 But uh th
 But but T_V_s don't have all uh
 No , so we we should use something else .
 uh buttons . Uh
 And you
 Yeah , and usually
 Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home um
 But I believe you will have an
 We do not control the T_V_ set so well .
 And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ , and it's
 Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , so we should think about
 Okay . So what about the clapping technique ? Um because you se
 I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us .
 It's quite complicated . Well , it's quite complicated . Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .
 And b
 Well , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh
 Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time . But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .
 Yeah , a peak . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .
 Yeah , that's true .
 Yes , so we don't want that .
 But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something . Well if you lost th I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . Uh that's just uh
 Maybe we can
 Something like that . Well , is there not something f something more easily
 Well uh
 Well , I don't think uh .
 No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself , so w we should use have uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .
 Yeah .
 just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility .
 Yes , something like that . But that will be very costly , I think . So that's not a good idea .
 Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , because that's his his field of expertise .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 I will .
 Yeah .
 Yes .
 Yes . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated um and it will become more costly also . Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . And there are some implepe imp
 Mm-hmm .
 Yep .
 And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh
 Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . So
 function ?
 It's a unique item uh
 Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . It's a different exactly . It's an uni an unique feature , and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and probably more i interesting than uh than the lights .
 It will be an a unique feature of our remote control .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . What should we choose in in design ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often . So
 Well , the extra functions .
 I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .
 Okay .
 Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function .
 Used option .
 Okay . Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that .
 Okay .
 Uh well yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important .
 Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . Well , we skip that .
 So
 Yeah . Yeah . So
 Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff . So
 Okay .
 No , no . So that's out of the question . So
 No .
 Nope .
 Yeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it . So
 Yeah .
 Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one .
 I think also . Yes . Well , we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface and
 No .
 Yeah .
 Okay , Ruud , how do you feel about that ? Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple
 Uh well if we um include other uh innovative
 functions uh then they uh might , 'cause young people uh like new features . So
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm yeah .
 Yeah , that's right .
 Okay , so this is is kind of uh
 Mm .
 Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound .
 Okay . Well , is it maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions . Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless
 Yeah .
 But but are we not in in the in the manual uh I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh
 Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
 Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise .
 Yeah , I don't know yet .
 But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? Because we do not implement uh a user history .
 Mm-hmm . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . W
 I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um
 Mm-hmm .
 Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that .
 And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button .
 Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions .
 Yes .
 But does it uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well , should we just use a
 Yeah , draw draw it on the board .
 Um it's already uh oh , we have a blank .
 Oh .
 Oh yeah , something like that .
 It's not really a stick , but
 It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable
 Yes . Yes .
 Hmm .
 Yeah , it can break down .
 when it's falling down or uh just a round uh button should be the trick , I think .
 Yes , yes .
 Yeah .
 And
 Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . I think it it will attract uh
 Yeah .
 more uh uh public , I think . But you're the marketing man .
 A younger uh Huh .
 And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use .
 Geez .
 Well , volume and
 something uh
 like that .
 Uh-huh .
 The programme up and down .
 Okay , yeah .
 And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want .
 Okay , that's good .
 Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness .
 Mm-hmm .
 But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that ,
 Um well , for we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah . We need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um
 I think .
 Yes ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay .
 uh our target audience .
 'Kay , but teletext is so uh is just scrapped .
 Okay .
 Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ?
 Um well , I do not want a full uh it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting .
 Okay . Okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 The ten digits .
 Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but
 Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change yeah .
 Mm-hmm . Yes .
 Yeah .
 A bit of a split mode . Uh l like Yeah . Dual channel watch . Okay , well um m maybe I should write that down . Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ?
 Change . Yes , yes .
 Yes .
 Yeah .
 Well you're the secretary .
 Mielsen .
 Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um
 Mm okay , but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already .
 Alright .
 Yeah , that's that's if you want to do it , Sebastian .
 Yeah .
 Sure .
 Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh
 .
 Okay , um
 Okay , so so um uh
 Volume . Programme .
 Uh dual channel . Uh
 Yes , that's important .
 And and do we want um
 The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so .
 the ten digits ?
 Well , are are you sure ? I'm not so sure .
 Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button .
 Yeah .
 Well , that's complicated , but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should uh shou you should know that .
 Yeah .
 I wouldn't buy it personally .
 If it were so .
 A remote control without the ten digits . Uh and I think the most
 Okay , I can imagine when
 I agree actually .
 I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough .
 Just elder elder people would would buy it , but
 Well
 But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .
 But
 Yep .
 Yeah , and if if we
 The older people only use five of them .
 Well , but how how often do you watch all these channels ?
 And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . So
 Often .
 No , you're probably right .
 Yeah .
 Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ?
 Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the
 The design . Okay . Well , y then there should be should done be done something specific with it .
 On the design .
 Well
 You c you can d make them very fancy by um
 And
 I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . So I'm I'm I do not agree
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Uh
 Okay , so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . Okay .
 Exactly , exactly .
 And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh
 Okay , speech .
 for
 Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . And it's very easy uh to find your remote control .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 To find yeah .
 So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . But maybe when we uh
 Yeah .
 Uh
 If if we would um drop the ten digits but keep the programme and the volume , because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay .
 Okay , okay .
 Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but
 Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision .
 Okay . Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that .
 Yes .
 So we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .
 Okay .
 Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function .
 Mm-hmm .
 So that's that's a big advantage , I think .
 Okay .
 Okay , g good .
 Okay .
 There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries . But maybe can we we can think something smart about it . There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . You have to do nothing for it .
 Mm .
 Yep .
 Okay . But
 But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ?
 M
 Twelve dollar fifty .
 Maybe , maybe not . I'll have to find that out .
 Because it seems like a very
 And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge ,
 Yes . So
 then there wouldn't be uh a big problem . 'Cause when
 No , that's very cheap .
 Is a cradle very cheap ?
 It's Oh , it's very cheap . That's no problem . It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts .
 I know , b uh but there should be an adapter as well .
 It's
 Yes , but they're they're mass production . They're very cheap . So it will cost us p practically nothing .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Okay . We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um
 I would like to hear um maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . Uh are there other things about the market we should know ?
 Um I think we dealt with the most important information . Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh
 want to sell to .
 So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people . But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . So
 Okay .
 Okay .
 I don't think that's a big problem
 Yeah .
 Okay , so although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh
 Yes . Yeah , profitable .
 Profitable .
 Profitable . We we yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people . Okay . O okay .
 Yes .
 Um Roo .
 I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think .
 Nothing to add .
 Sebastian ?
**********
 Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um
 Yeah ?
 Great .
 so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . So that's one the those are the choices we have to make . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that these kinds of things .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving . Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons .
 Yep .
 If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . And this even uh makes it more cheapy . So
 Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board
 Yeah .
 But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ? The circuit board .
 Mm-hmm . The circuit board .
 The board .
 The fewer buttons you can use on it .
 The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .
 No , it's th yeah .
 Yeah , okay .
 It's the other way around , yeah .
 Yeah .
 And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So that's
 that's another advantage .
 It shouldn't be a big issue .
 Well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition .
 So
 Yes , because I don't know
 Yes . I d I really don't know . So
 No .
 It can be costly . Maybe not .
 Okay . I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , I will have a look at it . Maybe you will get some information on that . Um I'm not sure how how that
 Yes .
 Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will uh have a lo uh look at it .
 Yep .
 Okay , great . Um
 well , I think we're qui quite done . Um for now we will have the lunch break .
 We're done , I think .
