 Do you need to change anything on it ? Because otherwise I will already open it .
 Um
 Mm , don't think so .
 Okay .
 Unless uh things have suddenly change again .
 Is it much changes ?
 Uh don't know . Maybe uh you've got new information , like uh last time .
 Uh I didn't No no . I do hot have
 Only the same information .
 Okay .
 Hello , Sebastian .
 Hello hello Mister P_M_ .
 I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well , in the control room .
 Well , that's where the thinking goes on .
 Oh , it's that Roo again , always late . Bongiorno .
 Bongiorno .
 I think you should punish him . You're the P_M_ .
 Hmm .
 Punish .
 I see some interesting okay .
 Possibilities , yeah ?
 You wish .
**********
 People , welcome back .
 Welcome . Uh
 The third meeting . Um I have some points I would like to uh some some issues I would like to point out . Um first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ?
 Oop .
 If you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down , so I could uh can uh um use that in the in the report . Um the second thing , um
 Yeah .
 I was th uh s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared .
 That's quite strange .
 Yes .
 Okay . We'll come to that later , I g I think . Um the agenda for now uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ?
 So
 No .
 Not at all .
 No .
 Okay . Um we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . Forty minutes in total for this .
**********
 So um I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made . Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation .
 Okay .
 'Kay .
 Hmm ?
 Alright .
 Oh .
 .
 Just press the okay button , it works .
 Yeah ,
 Okay .
 Um yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 My method ?
 How surprising .
 Well , findings . Uh
 Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables
 in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture , and that they want spongy material .
 Probably watch too much Sponge Bob .
 Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes uh m material . But we since we are concentrating on uh
 the younger group
 Uh w wait a sec wait a se uh could you go to the previous slide ? Um because I'm taking minutes and it
 Oh wait uh wait up .
 'Kay .
 Um were the important themes enclose . Yeah okay . The feel of to be spongy
 Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?
 Well , uh one example given was this , so um I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something .
 Not something dull .
 Okay .
 But they like dark colours , you said in the p
 No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful
 Okay .
 uh
 objects . But
 Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow . I had
 But can you can you go back to that slide ? The uh just one slide back , no no no .
 Which one ? This ?
 Yes .
 Okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy .
 Yes .
 Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ?
 Uh well , it might .
 But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . But
 Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge .
 Okay , so so , yeah , it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard . It it maybe it rubber or or yeah . Okay .
 Yeah , exactly .
 Yeah , and like uh the older group likes familiar materials , but that doesn't mean we should use wood ,
 Or we could make oh .
 So
 Okay .
 Well , this this is an example of what they would like . But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group ,
 I think we should use soft materials
 and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .
 Yeah .
 So we could provide
 both for the young and the old what they like .
 Well , that's interesting .
 It's quite interesting .
 You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .
 Yeah , o o
 Yes .
 I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone . It's the it's the rubber uh
 Yeah , yeah .
 Yeah , it is , it is i yeah .
 cover . And it's uh colourful . It looks likes a banana . We have the fruit , we have the colours . We have the simple design .
 Yeah .
 Do you know the phone ?
 I don't know the phone , but I can imagine it .
 It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five , I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away , the very
 Um thirty five .
 Oh , that one , yes . Now I kn uh oh , I know , I know .
 And the b the light blue and it's also in yellow .
 Yes , I I've seen it . I've seen it .
 You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? About th
 I've seen it , but
 Okay . Okay . Um uh okay . Do you have uh thit that was Okay . Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group . And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials . Okay .
 'Kay . Uh that's about it .
 Yes .
 Uh soft material .
 So So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . And what was even more important ?
 Uh the fancy look and feel .
 Okay . So that's the most important thing for our customers .
 Yes . Apparently .
**********
 Okay , Roo ,
 Yeah .
 could you do your presentation ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh
 the previous uh discussion .
 Um
 Okay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about .
 Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . These are both with uh with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just um , well , a weird um
 Shape .
 shape . So I suggest I couldn't uh I had a small uh mock-up uh sign on the on paper . But it didn't work . My pen didn't load um the information . So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um
 PowerPoint . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .
 Mm-hmm . But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good .
 Yeah . And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um I mean this is how you hold a remote control . Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery , s because um
 Yeah .
 Yes .
 Slippery .
 But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber . So it's easy in your hand Uh indeed .
 You have to grab it .
 Yeah . Yeah , exactly .
 Yeah .
 Yes . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , so you can get a really good grip on it . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . It's it's a lot easier . So m
 Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah , okay .
 Yes . But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .
 Okay , good .
 Great .
 Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on . Yeah .
 Yeah . Way too much I think for our goal , yeah .
 So if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty uh um
 Okay , b but I think we'll yeah .
 thirty c uh controls on it .
**********
 Okay , but I'll I'll go into that , because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing .
 We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape . Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that . But it's quite uh advanced and it's
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Right .
 it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source . Which brings me to the different energy sources . Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls . You really have to imagine like winding up your uh I d
 Great .
 Well , it would be very new to the market , but
 It would be very new , but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think . Uh Well , this is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're you you have to um make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish . It have it it has to move , that's the the sense of it . And you can store the energy in the in the thing .
 Yeah .
 Like the watch .
 I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny . I mean solar is of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel . Um hand dynamo
 Mm-hmm .
 It's very funny indeed .
 Mm-hmm .
 Indeed .
 But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also . You you walk and uh but uh you you're sitting on a couch .
 Well , maybe m
 Yeah , I know .
 Mm-hmm . Yes . But you know you know from your own watch your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something , well , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 And wha
 Okay .
 So , but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .
 Yeah .
 Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power . Yeah .
 Uh yes , it does . I'll come to that later . And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . So it's just like a mouse . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it .
 Okay .
 Um uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things . So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
**********
 Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .
 Yes . That is possible too . Yes .
 But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels I had some I had some information about it too . I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels . I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .
 Mm-hmm .
 Well
 Well , mayb uh well , m me neither . Maybe when you integrate some functions .
 This will be the remote , right ? Um with uh maybe a channel selector .
 Yeah .
 What about
 integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?
 Yeah , uh that's a possibility , but
 Uh it's do it's done before . Yes . It's quite quite good , yes .
 Because this is how you keep it
 But Flores ,
 think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for
 Volume ?
 Well , it's it well , i what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel . There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel .
 A volume , okay .
 Well , what about mute ?
 About mute . Well , yes .
 Thi i i m I guess uh th this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um
 Okay .
 Yes .
 Well , okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay .
 And click it to muten the device .
 Well , okay . It's quite goods .
 And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . So I'm looking for a way to
 uh make it a little different than the traditional ones . So maybe um I guess that that's something you two uh need to think about . Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel .
 Mm-hmm . Yes .
 Yeah .
 Um
 Wheel .
 Uh well , it's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers .
 Hmm . But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . We use this . And
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now . So maybe it's not no
 Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume . Nokia has a well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .
 .
 Hmm .
 Yes , but it uses two separate buttons .
 Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah .
 It doesn't use a . Well . Uh something for uh Roo here .
 For you too , yeah .
 Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb . So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .
 Wi within reach . Yes , you have to .
 Yes .
 yes .
 Okay . Sebastian . Um
 Yeah , yeah . Okay .
**********
 Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved . There's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . So that's a limitation .
 Yeah .
 About um the components , uh just the hardware . We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about .
 Yeah yeah , you can um I have some information about it . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute . Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . So that's the sample sensor . So if you say mute , it says mute again , and then it's um well , I believe it's uh
 Mm-hmm . Okay .
 Okay . So so okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 It performs the action . Yeah .
 Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is . So you say mute , he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Okay . Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . Okay . This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . Um no op I'm not very sure . No , it's not in here . If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper .
 Okay . Uh well uh d did we already decide on the display ?
 Okay .
 To
 Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here
 Yeah . Well , I don't have um I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information uh y I don't think you need it on a display . Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh 'cause uh uh all any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen , yeah .
 to think about .
 No .
 I I don't think either .
 No . I don't think you need it .
 On screen display . Yeah . Okay th
 Okay . Okay , well my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper . So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . The kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries . Otherwise it will not too advanced , uh well . It's in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries . But
 Okay . Good .
 Kineti okay .
 Hmm .
 Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy , too yeah .
**********
 Yeah , but that that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different .
 Yes . And I think it's more robust . It's more uh
 Yeah . Okay .
 But what about um the markets
 Uh it's more functional .
 uh wants colourfuls
 uh designs ? So if you use titanium
 No no , but the uh um that's what Sebastian said . He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . But but yet , I understood that the market is different . So um
 The titanium thing uh
 we have to skip it .
 Okay .
 Oh , sorry . Yeah .
 So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff , and we should uh use wood or something like that .
 Yeah .
 And yeah , the yeah , the older people liked wood .
 And I would think
 No , r rubber with colours .
 Oh okay , sorry . So it it needs to be rubber .
 No the
 Colourful and
 Yeah , the younger people liked soft material .
 Okay .
 Okay , spongy materials . Okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy . So
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 And they can be implemented with a regular chip ?
 Yes , they can . But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple
 Okay , but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker oh , evalu
 Well , I'm not very sure . Maybe that's an uh a different
 But but do we want the curved uh uh design , or
 I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull . I don't think c our customers will like it . And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels . So I think this is the best of two worlds .
 I it's too dull . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay . Okay .
 Okay , what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . Because it it's of cour
 Yes .
 It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . It's very unlogical .
 Yeah .
 But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .
 Well the there has to be some pointing at . But
 Well
 It depends also on your on your
 Well , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just to the other wall . Yeah .
 Well , it depends on your walls actually . If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably you're probably right . But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .
 All lights get absorbed , yeah .
 Yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light . So it has an it's easier . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker .
 So
 Yeah .
 Um with a with a regular chip .
 And the regular chip .
 I think uh it gives us the advantage of
 And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yeah .
 Yes , yes . And uh skip and skip the L_C_D_ part . I don't think it it's any uh value added thing . So
 I like the scroll wheels uh idea .
 Yeah .
 No . Think so too .
 Well , it looks uh yeah , well um according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology , and I mean L_C_D_ is well , ok I know , but it's m it's less um s standard than than
 Okay .
 Technology .
 Yes . It's not very flashy and new .
 Standard ?
 Well , we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part . That's the problem . Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it , because
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it .
 Yes .
 But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber ,
 Mm yeah .
 Uh I think our customers will go insane . It's it's too much .
 the fancy colours .
 Okay , okay .
 Yeah . Okay , I I agree . I think i Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to
 um add or or maybe thoughts or
 Nah , um n no , I don't think so . M
 No ? Sebast uh nee , Roo ? Roo , do you have any other
 Um no .
 Nothing more .
 Nothing more . Um
 Okay .
 Uh the n the next phase will be um
 Sebas
 the um not the what is the next phase f Flores ?
 Well , we we need to describe uh decisions now . So um on the energy , well , we decided . Chip .
 Okay .
 So i
 Okay .
 Okay .
 The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve . User interface um
 Okay , okay .
 Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ? Yeah , okay . Sorry , yeah .
 Yes , they can work . They cannot work with double-curved . That's that's problem . I'll check it for you .
 Oh , sorry . Yeah .
 Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .
 Yeah .
 Keep it in mind . And um the buttons , well we talked about it now .
**********
 The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design . And for you , the product evaluation . Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that . Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .
 Yes .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay .
 And I'm going uh to plan my holidays .
 Okay . So you will be on the Bahamas . Uh
 The project drawing is for the next
 Yeah , it's it's uh when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready .
 Yeah , right .
**********
 Okay . So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ?
 Yeah ? I can . Um maybe one of you could write it down . Great . Um
 I'll do .
 Uh you you need to help me . Um
 Okay . W start with the casing .
 The casing is curved , single-curved .
 Single-curved .
 Okay , single-curved case . Okay .
 Okay , well .
 Yeah . Okay .
 What about the energy source ?
 Traditional batteries uh and solar .
 But can there be uh wor can they work together ? Or do we have to choose between them ? 'Cause if we have to choose yeah ?
 No , they can be complementary . Uh al al I uh
 I I think they can . Yes .
 Okay . What if not ?
 Well , uh
 Every device
 It it should be . There should be really no problem . They can be supplementary . That's no problem . So
 Okay .
 Yeah . Okay , um th
 So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar . Okay .
 Battery and solar , yeah .
 What about uh the finishing of the case ?
 We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ?
 Yeah , with colourful rubber . Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers , but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish .
 Yeah .
 Okay , and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . uh black and yellow .
 Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Yeah .
 Grey and yellow .
 Grey yellow , okay .
 Yellow case and grey buttons , I think .
 Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course , but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours .
 Hmm .
 Oh , I think it's uh it's not very dull . It's quite modern actually . Don't you think ?
 Well , I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before .
 I believe the
 But you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button .
 And um
 Well , it it doesn't have to be red .
 Well well
 Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image or or I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group , I guess .
 Hmm .
 Okay .
 Or black and yellow .
 Black and yellow , yeah .
 Okay , but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . But
 Well , there is . Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print , with and uh
 Oh , I've read . Yes .
 Yeah .
 Yes , but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques . They're actually very slow in its techniques .
 No .
 Okay , so we have to deal with wh what's possible here .
 So
 So I'm afraid it's not possible .
 Yeah . Okay . Um more f more more decisions we made . Um
 Um
 A scroll-wheel .
 The scroll-heel . Yes , the voice recognition we already decided .
 Voice recognition , of course .
 Okay , so scroll-wheel . But there will be some additional buttons , I guess . And th the they should be spongy also , because they're they're rubber too .
 Yeah .
 Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two .
 What what did you say ?
 Well uh you can use well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too . So it has th the spongy uh feel also . So I I think that's okay .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , or you could use plastic buttons .
 In the rubber .
 I think rubber is nice . Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh uh devices , or or i
 Yeah , b
 But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually .
 .
 What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber .
 Uh is that uh does our our supplier say so ?
 It is not uh something uh it's no information I read about it or so , but it's just from
 Uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ? 'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .
 No , but but uh it
 Yeah . You could place a um uh this this would be the button .
 There the icons .
 The scroll-wheel , I mean . And you could place
 Yeah , b yeah .
 the indica th th the signals the
 Yes .
 So you don't touch the icons that much .
 That's okay .
 Yeah , that's possible , but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case .
 So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .
 No no , there's no painting , only uh yellow or
 Yeah .
 But it's into the rubber .
 Yeah , but but the the plus or the minus .
 Yes , the signs .
 You have to draw the
 Yeah , but this is on the pla yeah , I know . Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean . What about um making this rubber
 Yeah , it's on the cover . So if you uh
 You just move the problem .
 and making this plastic ?
 Uh I see what you mean .
 Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . So maybe they can combine these two .
 Yeah . Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel . But the front ,
 Yeah .
 on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber . I mean
 Mm-hmm .
 Well , I'm I'm not so sure , I think it c should be
 Y uh can you separate these uh these
 Well , I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber . So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber .
 I know , but do you touch this or do you touch this ?
 I think both .
 I mean , I I never touch between the buttons .
 I do . Or the s uh the sideways . Or the the back . Or the back .
 I do .
 I think
 Yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways . The side , but do you touch between the the these buttons ?
 I think
 Yes , especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have uh a lot of space to touch . So you just have it in your hand completely or or i you play with it .
 Okay . Well , we do not have very much time uh left . Um I guess you two have to figure that out . I'm going to leave the decision to you , um because you have to make its prototype , and um yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities and uh so I'm going to leave it the decision with you . Um Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Um not quite . Um what about
 uh the chips ? We use the regular chip ? Okay .
 Regular .
 Yeah .
 And
 Use with .
 Well no , I think that's about it .
 Yes .
 Okay . With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions . The chip is is not really
 The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_ . That's all . And we've decided not to use L_C_D_ . So
**********
 Um okay , then I think we are uh quite finished .
 Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um
 .
 For the finishing touch .
 Yeah ? Yeah , um if you write wrote anything down , uh could you put it on the shared folder ?
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Uh yeah .
 Yeah .
 But um
