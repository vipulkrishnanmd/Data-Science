 Okay . Here we go .
 Alright , the agenda for thi oh .
 Alright . Um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave
 gave it . And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . And um evaluate the product , as a group . And um
 Okay .
 So first we'll have the prototype presentation . Do you need the um PowerPoint for this ?
**********
 Um yeah . I just got a few slides , so show them .
 Alright .
 Thank you .
 Um
 Do you want to present it ?
 This is what we came up with . It's a pretty simple design . It's um based on a mango ? Yeah . And we
 Yeah , here we are .
 Mango shape .
 On ? A mango . Okay .
 Yeah . And we have the company logo here and this will be the
 infrared here and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind yeah .
 The L_E_D_ .
 Oh . Okay .
 I'm sorry . What was the where's the L_E_D_ ?
 Oops .
 It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . And then the other one is the power . And uh we just have a simple design . We wanted it all to be
 Oh . Okay .
 So it's palm-held .
 accessible from your thumb yeah palm-held and all the
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 buttons are accessible from your thumb .
 Notice you have a number ten button .
 So you don't have to
 Oh that was a mistake , wasn't it ? Right no , that's a zero . Take that one off .
 Okay .
 You just need the nought .
 Sorry . I was in charge of the numbers .
 No problem . Ah .
 And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or
 thirt the plus . You can go one , three or something . You press that first and then you go one three yeah .
 So one plus one would be eleven , or
 Oh . You press a plus button ?
 Oh okay . I've never heard of that kind before .
 Well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and
 Yeah because if you on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Oh , there's no e okay .
 So the plus and then yeah .
 Oh .
 I
 Okay .
 But
 Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ?
 No no , th all that's why we have all these numbers . These numbers um
 these numbers all work independently up to nine .
 Yeah but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . 'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards .
 Yeah .
 Oh no . Uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine .
 Yeah I know , but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ?
 Sixty .
 You p
 Oh .
 No you press the plus first . I I well it doesn't we haven't really s I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , but she says plus press which what do you think is simpler ? It's a
 Oh .
 Well I don't mind , we can further define that .
 I th
 Um
 I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five .
 Yeah .
 Yeah it wouldn't be a problem . But I was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do .
 Yeah .
 But I suppose it's not as snappy .
 Well the there is a there's a delay on remotes I think . Where you can have it it's like a five second input time . So as long as you hit them dada
 Oops .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah . If you don't put it
 Yeah . Yeah , that yeah .
 Yeah .
 it should be fine . As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah . So
 Um
 Was there so on the top there is volume and
 And channel , which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like
 A channel .
 Channel up volume up . Okay cool .
 C_ and V_ .
 Just so we can flick
 Right , where um where's the power button ?
 Yeah .
 It's in the middle of one of the little R_s .
 It's the bigger R_ .
 It's the R_ .
 Oh okay .
 So it's just like . We deci
 Yeah , so it's all accessible . Without m taking your hand off the remote .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . Uh e ergonomics are all considered . Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Oh okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah . Ergonomic , definitely ergonomic .
 And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . Okay .
 It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . But yeah , no I mean it's a different movement so yeah . Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , and it just feels feels different . Would you like to feel it yourselves ? How it fits in the palm of your hand ?
 Yeah .
 The spon yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Bit of a stress ball feel .
 Yeah .
 Yes . I would .
 My goodness . There you go . Genevieve ? Yeah .
 Thanks . And you ?
 Yes . Oh it's nice . Oh I think I killed the five . I did . I killed the four . Oh god .
 And something hmm .
 O
 Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . Or the combination .
 Oh it smells good .
 Of Play Doh yeah .
 Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish .
 Oh right .
 'Cause it'd be quite subtle and
 Yeah . It looks more
 Think like vanilla and banana would .
 Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black .
 Yeah .
 Okay yeah .
 So that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . I mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the yeah , seasonal .
 Kinda Christmas , you know .
 Yeah , yeah , yeah .
 Apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki
 Yeah .
 The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of , and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor .
 Cool .
 Yeah .
 Okay . Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb .
 Yeah .
 Um , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it .
 Alright , thank you very much . Good work everyone .
 Bravo
**********
 Alright . And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . So , I have
 Mm-hmm .
 something I'm going to
 You want the
 Oh wait a minute . Do you need to do a presentation first ?
 I don't know what order it goes in . I have one .
 Yeah . I'm gonna check that out for a second .
 Mm go
 What time is it anyw
 Oh yeah sorry you're right . Evaluation criteria is next in line . Yeah .
 Evaluation cri Okay . That's me .
 Hello .
 Oh there we go .
 Okay . Come on my computer . Come on .
 Sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties . Should I press it again ?
 Just press um function eight again .
 Last time I did that it sh
 Okay . You're right .
 And then again I think .
 One more time .
 Oh . Still not there .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay now I think for this one I could Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it . Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen .
 Um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do .
 Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . So basically the lower p the lower the points the better .
 Okay so question number one . Does the remote whoops . Sorry . Oh I'm not gonna be able um , I'll do it on the whiteboard . I can't change it so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once .
 Okay .
 I'll write down our scores up on the
 Ooh .
 Okay so number one . Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ?
 Mm .
 Feel I think . We've been quite successful with the rubber coating and
 Yeah .
 The look is a little bit more playful .
 Well
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different . It's not your traditional yeah .
 Oh definitely different yeah .
 I think the colour has a lot to do with it . I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen . It's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek red , black and yellow , and orange . Um
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Oh you were only given red and black ?
 Oh okay .
 Yeah so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . So we want it to be stand out that way , anyway .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 But if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something
 Okay .
 Yeah . A metallic-y finish we were thinking .
 Mm-hmm .
 Well I know know it's for rubber . I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy .
 Yeah .
 Polished . Okay
 Yeah .
 Yeah . I kinda I like the potato look . It's very different . It's what ? Oh sorry the mango the mango look . Yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood .
 Yeah .
 Oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg .
 We we were we were thinking about yeah .
 It's mango . It's mango .
 Potato's fine . Potato's fine .
 Yeah . Totally . It's really adaptable .
 So I myself would say a one or a two .
 Yeah . I would say two . Personally .
 I w I'd say two I think .
 It's a two ?
 Okay , and p
 For the
 Fanciness .
 fancy
 Yeah .
 One being true . So
 I uh two , three .
 Two . Okay , actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah and the use of the rubber .
 Use of the rubber , the use of the L_E_D_ .
 Yeah .
 For the anti-R_S_I_ .
 Yeah .
 The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , there's no L_C_D_ control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . In some aspects it is , like we said .
 Isn't
 Mm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . I'd say maybe three .
 I'll go for three as well .
 Yeah . And I think I mean it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . So I mean I we'll put three , but I think we actually reached our goal .
 Yeah . Though it was our specification .
 No . Wouldn't be simple , yeah .
 Yeah we want it simple .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 We didn't want it any more than that . Okay question number three . Uh , will it be easy to use ?
 I think so . Yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah very . I think one for that . Yeah . No .
 Yeah . Yeah . S
 Yeah I think it's you can't really get confused with that . I mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system . But once that's figured out , it should be fine .
 Yeah . One .
 Yeah .
 Th
 The plus number thing .
 Yeah that's the only thing yeah .
 Yeah and perhaps the turning on but
 Number four . Is this a good-looking remote ? Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
 Mm .
 It's definitely
 Again I think the colour comes into this .
 Yeah colour will definitely be a factor .
 Mm-hmm .
 I think that the logo could be smaller .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 And maybe not such a prominent way . Maybe like at the bottom , kind of .
 But the
 Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent .
 Not in
 Whoops .
 Oh it just had to be on there I guess .
 Should just not touch it . This time it's the three I killed . I was just wondering if it should be like flatter .
 Yeah .
 Don't worry .
 Or
 I suppose I've got quite big hands .
 I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand .
 Well
 Yeah . But you know what I've just thought of there now . What where's it gonna sit in your living room ? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ?
 Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like
 Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit .
 Yeah . But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand .
 round .
 Oh . That's true .
 It would still be comfortable I think . We c we could handle it I think .
 Yeah .
 Thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly .
 Maybe , it could it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up . Like that .
 Yeah .
 Oh that would be nice .
 Ah it'd fall over all the time though . It'd be annoying .
 Uh yeah , it's less um , what's th ha .
 Yeah .
 I g
 If it's weighted maybe . Details , details . Okay . So , is this a good-looking remote ? Would we wanna show it off to our friends ?
 H it's got higher centre of gravity like that .
 'Kay we're done designing . Come on .
 Three . You would though , 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes .
 Yeah .
 I think , it was another colour and it was like I think it'd look okay . I think maybe a two .
 Yeah ?
 I mean I gue yeah , it's personal taste , but
 I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay , so should we say two for that ? Yeah ?
 Sure .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay . Uh , question number five . What's um will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy .
 I think we have to market it in the right way , that um to say that it is simplistic . So people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . We have to market it .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it .
 Yeah . And the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , ooh no .
 And the kinetic energy part . Yeah . Don't shake
 Yeah .
 Shake it and the buttons fall off .
 Durable .
 But you know , those'll be firmly on .
 Oh no the plus . You're use the zero . Make a new one .
 No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , but I know I am , aren't I ?
 But you're our Marketing Expert .
 I think they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? About ten pounds . Fifteen ?
 But you don't have to buy batteries . So in the long term this can actually save you money . So we'll market it that way too .
 Yeah .
 Mm , yeah , that's true .
 Oh . Exactly . Exactly .
 Yeah . Good point .
 So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it'll
 Yeah . I would give it a two still though .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah . Okay number six . Can someone read it out ? Or
 Mm .
 Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 Um yeah . So that was mainly that the statistics we said
 Yeah .
 I think it does very well .
 Oh yeah .
 Because yeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . And it's just you won't have to think about it . You don't have to look down to find them . They're clearly there , easy to use . Simple .
 The zap yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah I guess the I think the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . But they're not you and I really . So . Okay so one ? Okay . Number seven . C Heather could you push it down ? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . Now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented ?
 Uh
 Yeah . Mm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 We have the alarm system .
 Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it'll vibra
 It
 Yeah l lights on and , or flash as well . But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm .
 It'll be again in the marketing .
 I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up .
 Yeah . The light it will .
 Or or was it gonna make a noise ?
 But
 Yeah . But when the alarm's not yeah . If you
 But both
 You press the button it makes a noise right ?
 It turns into a duck and starts quacking . Here I am . Um
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 You could s Yeah .
 Oh , that would be brilliant . I'd be tempted to
 Yeah . Awesome . Awesome .
 Well the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up .
 Yeah .
 It would have to be in the market
 I though w it was gonna make a noise .
 Okay .
 Yeah . Alarm , but you can't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself .
 Yeah but you still couldn't see it .
 It would just be a little speaker on the back or something .
 Okay .
 We oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype . But yeah , it'll be there . So we can we could say that
 Yeah . Yeah . It w yeah . Sorry .
 Oh okay . Whoo . Okay .
 We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . Okay . Um
 Yeah , totally .
 Yeah . Sorry Heather . That wasn't very clear .
 No problem , mm .
 Question number eight . Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . So it has to be yeah , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . The plus thing needs to be worked on .
 Totally .
 So the plu the plus w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , won't it ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah I think just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use .
 Yeah .
 Well
 Yeah .
 Do
 Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ? So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least .
 Yeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter .
 That kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press I don't know why .
 Mm .
 Yeah but you don't have to press zeros .
 You could just press six enter , or one two enter . Yeah .
 Oh okay . Right .
 And or sixty six enter , y
 And then like twelve , enter .
 Alright , aye .
 Yeah .
 Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward . Yeah . Good
 Yeah .
 Um , okay so we can we'll say yes it's uh one ? Okay .
 I'd say w yeah one . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Ooh . Mm .
 Question number nine . Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , which was repeated strain injury ? Um , which affected over a quarter of users .
 Oh .
 Yeah .
 Injury .
 Hmm .
 S
 I think so . It's like right in the
 But if you're zapping yeah . I don't think it will f
 Your thumb might get a little bit uh
 Yeah , that's what I was thinking . We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about .
 Yeah , the biology .
 Yeah .
 But it is soft .
 Mm-hmm .
 It's soft , and
 And that's kind of what the um
 Mm .
 Mm .
 And people could
 the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_ , so maybe it is but
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 I don't know what other options there are .
 I think we're getting that's true .
 Yeah .
 Could I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 So , one or two do you think ?
 I I'd say t two . Yeah .
 I think yeah , I think too .
 Two okay . Okay number ten . Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? Is the yellow
 Yeah .
 Yes we did .
 Yeah .
 N We we can't really do that because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . It won't stand out . So n it's not always gonna be the same colour .
 Mm-hmm .
 It sounds like the colour's something that we
 Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . So it could be grey on the banana one .
 Yeah .
 Gray , yeah .
 Yeah , could be grey .
 Yeah .
 But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though , depending on the
 Yeah that's right , we didn't even rea
 So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ .
 Mm .
 Yeah . I think this is the
 Yeah .
 the factor that we've been least successful in confronting .
 Okay .
 Perhaps a metallic or or like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . No ?
 Mm , yeah .
 Yeah . And the buttons in the middle .
 That isn't rubber .
 Okay . So , do you think that's more of a three then ? Three , four ?
 Yeah .
 Four I think . Well I don't what do what
 Four ?
 Well we have good reasons for it , so we but we can still put a
 Hum .
 a four ?
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Okay , and final question . Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? Current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess .
 I would say so .
 Following that briefing we did .
 But maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Like um the colour scheme names and stuff .
 Yeah .
 With the with the colours .
 Yeah .
 No , uh , are the plates interchangeable ? I think I missed a few they are ? So you can have banana and kiwi and okay . Okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , like maybe it'll become more
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates .
 Mm-hmm .
 It is .
 I think w yeah , I think one . Well that was our brief and we followed the brief . Well we haven't got a big banana but
 The thing is , I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , I don't know if you'd instantly say mango .
 Oh yeah .
 Be like
 No .
 No .
 Yeah .
 Maybe if it was scented . Yeah we have money for that . Um
 Oh that would be class .
 Oh yeah . There we go . That would be great .
 Um
 Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ?
 Yes we do . So I wh what was I gonna put for that ? A two for fashion ?
 Oh .
 I would say two .
 Yeah . Two .
 Okay .
 Okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven
 It's
 is
 One point nine or something ? I don't know these things . Um , between one and two .
 It's
 Yeah .
 Between one and two .
 Between okay . Um .
 So that's pretty fantastic .
 Close to two . Yeah .
 Yeah , that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one .
 I got
 Alright .
 Does that seem right then ?
 Yeah , 'cause we've a four to bring down .
 Okay .
 Mm .
 Uh , aye .
 It seems like it should be more around two .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Uh , should've added five .
 Do we have an online calculator ?
 I'm attempting to do that right now .
 This is .
 Okay .
 Yeah it is one point nine . Ooh .
 Yay .
 Oh wow . Well done . Well that's excellent .
 Go Heather Pauls .
 Yeah .
**********
 Alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget
 . And um my computer's frozen .
 And now it's not . Okay . So
 um in our shared folder , if everyone could go there right now , um
 Sorry . Are you gonna do that ? Okay .
 I'm going to um steal a cable . Um it's it's um
 Is that the project document ?
 it's an Excel file . Oh .
 Production costs .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . 'Kay there we go . Um , production costs . And um I have to access that as well . One moment .
 It says it
 'Kay so far I've added what I think or what is going on ? Great .
 It's blinking at me .
 It's locked for editing . Read only . I'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing . I have the original in my um
 my email account .
 Oh is it locked 'cause I'm in it ?
 I dunno .
 I think it just means that we can't add any more to it now . Have you have you completed it ?
 Or okay .
 No . No , I was hoping that you guys could .
 Oh right . Okay .
 Okay .
 Um , there we go .
 Okay here we go . So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . So um if you can look up at the screen , um the large screen , oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think . Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Oh right .
 Um we're using a regular chip .
 Yeah .
 Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around . That's another three . We're already at five . Um , we're using plastic and rubber , so
 Double double-curved yeah .
 Yeah .
 Good thing plastic is free , we're at eight . Um
 What about a special colour ? Are we using that ?
 S
 Yeah . I guess we should do it just for one kind . So it's like special colour well we'll have two colours right ? Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons . So we can
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Um , we have push button interface , so that's inexpensive . And um we have a special colour for the button , and we also have a special form .
 And a special material .
 And a special material . Yeah .
 Oof .
 Which puts us just barely under budget . Hurray .
 Congratulations guys .
 Mm . 'S good .
 Yeah . Good work guys . So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros .
 That's good .
 Awesome .
**********
 And back to our PowerPoint . So we've
 'Kay . Yes we are . So we need to do a product evaluation , again , which is probably um
 I dunno . A different extension of a
 Of the actual project rather than the product ?
 Yeah .
 Hmm .
 A project ? Is is yeah .
 Yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership , teamwork .
 So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it .
 Yeah . Alright so um
 Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity ?
 I think we were pushed .
 Mm-hmm .
 Pushed for creativity ?
 I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task . So I think we could've done with a bit more time .
 The ma
 Or materials .
 Yeah .
 Ye Okay . So it'd be like
 need more time and
 materials . But you were allowed m creativity ? I think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah and the conceptual and functional . Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m
