 Okay .
 Okay , almost there .
 Okay . We'll sta I'll use the PowerPoint , I guess .
**********
 How was that , was that fun ?
 Mm . Very fun .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Okay .
 Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but I will do . Upsidaisy . Um Um we Yeah .
 Okay .
 Hmm .
 E excuse me I forgot my
 Alright , okay , yeah .
 copy .
 He's gonna get his pen .
 Oh right . Okay .
 Um Will you guys first with your prototype
 um before we get to the good news ?
 Yeah , there's good news ? Oh .
 Uh we have budget problems .
 Mm .
 Oh .
 I'm afraid you're all sacked . Oops . I don't even have this on .
 Cutbacks .
 Hmm .
 Okay , have you got a presentation to make ? No . Okay so it's just your your show .
 Okay .
 No , not mine yet .
 Oh .
**********
 Um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see . Yeah .
 Okay . Sure .
 Okay .
 We made three for you .
 Three ? Oh .
 Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st
 Tomato ? What tomato ? I don't recall a tomato .
 Look . Oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over . So . Okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . The yellow there is the um the slogan , yeah , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , um but mainly it's speech recognition .
 Ah I see , okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 Logo .
 Okay , brilliant .
 Okay .
 Okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . Mm I'm not sure about that . Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want .
 Alright , okay .
 Right .
 That's groovy .
 Yeah .
 Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it .
 Uh can I have
 Yeah , sure . Um that one is Oh no , it's delicate .
 Oh sorry s
 At Oh dear .
 That's that's already got its stand that one . That's it stand . It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . Um the black on the back is the slogan .
 Alright , okay .
 Okay , brilliant mm .
 Okay , nice and obvious there , if it's standing up , I guess , yeah .
 Uh yeah , that Well , we did think of that .
 Yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed .
 Oh right , okay , brilliant . Like that from its centre .
 Where you're , yeah , uh were you're holding it kind of
 Yeah . Well , if you hold it , you can you all can hold it , is it does actually feel quite ergonomic , if you've got small hands . Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized . It would have to be a bit bigger . Okay . Um that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah . Okay .
 Mm .
 Yeah , okay . Yeah , scale model , yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Um and um then the buttons . Yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . Tried to keep it simple . Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . We used those . And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . It's not in the traditional place , but um it's quite an obvious place .
 Alright , excellent .
 Okay .
 No . It's out of the way as well , I suppose , so .
 Excellent .
 So there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too .
 Oh yeah , yeah .
 Yep .
 This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences .
 Okay , so so Barney the banana .
 A a more friendly type of
 Right , right . It's to uh induce more television watching I suppose or
 Ah excellent , just what we need .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Say it for the camera .
 Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Right , right .
 Cool yeah . Well , nice to have uh options at least . 'Kay and
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 So are there any um improvements or issues or
 It won't stand .
 Oh there are issues , oh there are issues .
 Just let it lie down , it wont stand .
**********
 Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance .
 Oh .
 Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . Um unfortunately
 the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros .
 Mm .
 Oh .
 So we have to rea Sorry , I've accidentally highlighted somehow Um . There we go .
 What's on the uh on the left ?
 Okay .
 Oh god , why is it doing that ?
 Ooh .
 There we go . So basically , um in order to save our two Euros
 um I was thinking
 that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened .
 Mm-hmm . More like a traditional remote control .
 Um .
 Yeah , I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out . And by doing so Oh no , hold on . Doesn't save us quite as much .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 I don't know what's going on with this again .
 W why is the uh double curved two of them ?
 Oh , good point .
 And double curve on both sides ?
 Um .
 Curve . Yeah , this is double-curve , no ? This is double-curve . It This one is single curve .
 That's sort of curve in and out .
 Is i
 Mm .
 'Cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides .
 So double-curve .
 No , I think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . Okay , I might be wrong though .
 Like an S_ shape .
 Okay .
 Like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side . Hmm . Hmm .
 I don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape .
 Okay .
 A curvature is like the this case .
 Maybe .
 'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there , right . got two of them
 Okay .
 Yeah , and why why I've got it two , I don't know , I can't seem to select any more however .
 Okay . Well we can work around that um
 Mm-hmm .
 Right . No .
 Cut things out .
 But you think it should be one .
 It's meant to be one , yeah , I don't know why I put two in there , but um Hold on till I find it , I think this shift button might be stuck again .
 Okay .
 No maybe the shift button's stuck in . Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us
 Yeah .
 Mm . Should
 Oh that's fine .
 Yeah , so we're
 Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty .
 Cool .
 Cool .
 Um
 So we could even add something .
 We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . What ?
 We should fire the accountants .
 Fire the accountants .
 Ah yeah , we could add things .
 Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys . Does that work ? No mm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I know , that just extends it as well . I don't know .
 Uh you can do one thing . You just select one box outsi yeah , this box . Then move it with the help of this Okay . Just uh just uh Okay , just a minute .
 It One of the buttons is sticking , I don't know .
 Okay . No input , like this . Shift . No it's not . Yeah , it's not working . Should we ask Meli Should we ask our technical expert Melissa ?
 No , it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck , or something .
 Is it the other shift button maybe ?
 No that's fine . Um we've worked out what it would be anyway .
 Did you try both shift buttons ? It could be the other side .
 Yeah .
 Cancel . Piss off .
 That's too bad .
 Oh well , never mind . Um .
 Right , so that's finances and I dunno what we what could we reckon we could add ?
 Um
 Well maybe we could add something , but maybe if What do you th We're trying to save money , so . Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . Maybe I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , because it's not in an ideal place right now .
 Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . So
 Yeah .
 Yeah yeah .
 Well that's that's uh Okay , so project evaluation . We have under twelve Euros fifty .
**********
 Project process , how do we think that went ?
 Are we happy ?
 Oh .
 Mm .
 Yeah I think we have a a winning product .
 Okay .
 Evaluation .
 Oh we've been writing this up for m months .
 I think it went quite smoothly .
 Uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ?
 W I think we were very creative .
 No , I mea I think it means sort of individually .
 Oh right , okay .
 Yes , no , maybe ? Okay . Groovy . So uh we're just gonna . Uh yeah , okay . Teamwork ? Leadership , sorry .
 Mm-hmm .
 Great leadership .
 Excellent leadership .
 Thank you very much . You're all get you're all getting a raise . Uh teamwork . I thought went well . Yeah .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , everyone got enough input , I think .
 Uh and well means , yeah . The technical stuff was brilliant . Let's buy more . Uh Right . Um I don't know what , new ideas found , means , to be honest .
 Yeah , we
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 These pens are are neat though .
 Yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that . We discussed all the new ideas , but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals , we couldn't use these , but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this . These are new ideas we And new shapes , everything . At le Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Mm 'kay . Groovy . So just general thumbs up for all of us then . That kind of unfortunately is too quick . Uh . I suppose yeah . Um .
 Hmm .
 Okay . Well um .
 Hmm .
 Okay .
 Uh so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this , right .
 Mm .
 Right , right .
 That's it , um I think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you . Uh
**********
 Let's see if I can get this bloody thing to work . Whoops .
 Uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay .
 Yeah , maybe .
 So
 Does it go back in , does it ? Reusable .
 Something we should get .
 I don't know what this is but it's really really annoying .
 So
 Uh Brian , have you have you finished ? Uh mine needs also this .
 Uh-huh .
 Um I have , yes .
 Huh ?
 At last mine is also the presentation .
 Oh right , okay , you've got more , okay . Sorry uh . It didn't bother to tell me that on this
 Yeah , yeah .
 Oh , you got a presentation , sorry .
 Oh ok
 S
 thing .
 Is it ?
 Okay .
 Uh is the project evaluated , that is mine .
 Doesn't tell me .
 Oh you're doing that .
 Yeah .
 We evaluated ourselves , we thought we were great .
 Yeah .
 Uh .
 Mm , love to eat that now . Kind of a green banana now .
 Anybody
 Mm .
 Clay covered banana .
 It's this as well , sorry , we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we've got . I've got .
 O okay , hold on .
 blue .
 I wonder w which cell do I want .
 It's fun to touch .
 Yeah .
 So . Yeah .
 Okay , I didn't realise you had that bit .
 So .
 Oh could you pass the tomato please . Sorry . Thank you .
**********
 So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . How we are going to means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not . How mu What rating we will give to these products . So of course this is will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay .
 We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . Then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ? Means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . Then marketing strategy of the company . As we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s
 Mm-hmm .
 Sorry . Sorry , carry on .
 Yeah . So but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . So
 Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . I'm having this scale this scale , so we have to do it on a board .
 Okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay .
 Alright , okay . The board working again , is it ?
 the user requirem I think .
 Do we have the uh the marker for the board ?
 Uh .
 Um .
 Thank you .
 There it is .
 So .
 So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . First of all uh comes user requirement . So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . I I will first I would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Um I think
 Yeah , it did . It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . Um so . Does it work ? Yeah . So .
 S
 Yeah .
 When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_ , so yeah , of course we haven't actually got a working model yet .
 So what do you think you will personally give . Seven . Uh .
 I would say seven . Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ? I can't True or false ? No sorry tr one is true .
 One , yeah .
 Uh one is means highest ranking , okay . But I think highest ranking is seven , or one ?
 Yeah .
 No it's it's like true is one end , and false is the oth
 No that's false .
 Okay , right right . So it's one for from your point of view . And what do you say our Industrial Expert ?
 Okay , so one .
 Yep .
 Uh .
 It's hard to know . I I give it a two .
 Uh d you can you can tell on on the like I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert . But you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ?
 Okay .
 Um yeah , I think i it might even exceed it um .
 But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons .
 Um I'm gonna give it a two . Two .
 Two . And what about uh you , Brian ? You will go for one . Okay . Uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , and Uh yeah , lower end . And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , two or three kinds rather , and Yeah . So .
 Oh , I'll go for a one .
 Basic requirements but of the pro of the project .
 Yeah th
 Mm yellow .
 Uh-huh .
 Come on that was the tha
 'Kay .
 Uh-huh .
 Okay .
 Being fruitist .
 Is that no is that not trends ?
 Uh no , uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that , because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . So you can what shape a person will like . So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh-huh .
 But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . I think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . We were coming up with one product .
 Uh maybe . Okay but I will I will personally won't give it beyond three . So we can
 No , I mean uh obviously your opinion , I'm just trying to
 Okay .
 He's a tough cookie .
 Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe .
 Three or four ? Uh , no sorry , it should be
 Six . Five or six .
 What are we doing ?
 No sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , we are doing a very wrong thing . Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , and that's I have taken it very wrongly . Yeah uh three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly . So we can say one or two . because it is one point eight uh two , so we will do two . Yeah . So where were the trends .
 What are we doing ?
 Adding them up ?
 We're gonna average them ?
 Okay . So seven fourths . About one point f one point eight .
 Oh .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Oh I see .
 Yeah round it up to two . So trends .
 Okay , yeah .
 Can you explain what you want us to write there ?
 Sorry ?
 How it how conforms to the current trends ?
 Yeah , again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something . Uh .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay . Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , so I would actually give it a three . Tha three or four , I'm not sure . Three . Go for three . That's fine .
 Okay . Yeah . Uh
 'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons ,
 um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . So I give it a a four . I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for
 Mm .
 for technology .
 Yeah , I am sort of pret uh Just the fruit does me in , I mean uh it might
 it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , so um Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it . Um so yeah I'd say about four as well .
 Yeah .
 Okay . Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them .
 Mm-hmm .
 So and in this way our product is good . And the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . So that is also ef that also Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . And yes . It is cus spongy also . So they can play with it , it's quite good . So then I think , maybe I can give it two . So four five ten thirteen thirteen . So we can Is it fine ? So what about company strategy ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Well it was yellow .
 Um .
 Yeah , the company strategy , okay . Um there was lot of discussing , that was good . Um I feel I got my say . Um so I'd give the company strategy
 a
 two .
 Okay .
 Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . Is that the question ?
 Okay . Is it ? Okay .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Um .
 Okay , so
 one or two . One . Okay , just leave it , it's fine .
 Yeah .
 I'll go with two .
 So what about you , Brian ?
 Um yeah , a three .
 Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a
 a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by
 Mm .
 Yeah , and me also , like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one . So four six six
 So one and a half .
 Yeah , one .
 half . So we can say two or one Okay . So th seven seven .
 A two .
 Uh overall we are getting two something , but we can round it as two .
 Yep .
 Okay .
 Cool , groovy .
 Yeah . So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good . So we can launch it . Yeah .
 S
 Cool .
 Brilliant .
 Woo-hoo .
**********
 In which case we are done .
 'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget .
 Okay .
 Cool .
 So yeah . Great .
 Champagne lunch anyone ?
 Yeah .
 Uh .
