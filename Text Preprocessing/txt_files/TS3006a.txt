 Mm uh .
 We're the first .
 Mm .
 We're the first ones .
 Marketing Expert , yes .
 Mm .
 So you found your spots .
 Yes .
 Move to the meeting room . Okay .
 Bling bling . Yeah .
 Right .
 Okay .
 Uh where has my screen gone ?
 Hi .
 Hello , good day . Yep .
 Oh yeah , we have to talk in English , huh .
 Hmm .
 Yeah . My screen is gone . Oh .
 It's called black .
 Kick-off meeting , wow .
 I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff uh .
 It's uh looks uh nice .
 Hmm ?
 Okay .
 I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow . I don't know how much preparation you guys did , but not a lot .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 No , it's it was uh not enough .
**********
 You see this beautiful presentation . Okay let's get started .
 Yeah . Very nice .
 Yeah .
 Uh I sort of prepared this . Uh opening acquaintance , tool training , uh how to use the things here . Uh project plan discussion , and yeah then the rest of the meeting . Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control , that's both original , trendy and user-friendly .
 Mm .
 Mm-hmm .
 So , hope you have good ideas . I don't . Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom . Uh functional design , then we do some in individual work , then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera .
 I did my best .
 Not yet .
 And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up .
 Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . Um
 Yeah .
 uh we should take some practice . I have some instructions now to do that . Uh well you know how to the documents work .
**********
 So
 Uh this for toolbar . You see it next . Um
 we have a pen . And we can use this pen to perform . Yes . So
 Operations .
 It doesn't always work .
 Yes . Okay so you can
 Yeah .
 draw .
 Draw . Alright .
 Okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera . Okay ?
 'Kay .
 Uh
 Okay . Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal .
 Uh you should explain
 Uh with different colours and with different pen widths . And you should explain why you draw that particular animal . So , Julian .
 Okay .
 Don't take up too much space .
 Um yeah .
 Different pen widths , how do you do that ?
 Uh with the format menu .
 Oh okay .
 And use different colours etcetera .
 It's a giraffe . Yeah .
 Are you serious ?
 And what's that supposed to be ?
 Should it be one
 Oh yeah . Oh yeah four legs . Uh-huh .
 Okay .
 Giraffe's yellow .
 Uh it needs some uh some yellow uh
 Oh format .
 Can you use one blank sheet per drawing ? Or so y you must save it at the end and then
 Yeah .
 Yeah you can press the next button , which is uh yeah . I'll show you . Yeah . In file menu .
 That's some spots .
 I in the file option menu .
 Okay , then m make a new one .
 No .
 How much time do we have to draw anyway ? 'Cause I can take forever on this .
 Yeah .
 Okay . Do I have to explain uh why I chose this uh this animal ?
 Yeah . What is it ?
 I think it's a it's a great animal . It's a it's a giraffe .
 A giraffe okay . Yeah I see a long neck but
 Yeah , that's a
 It's more like a dinosaur .
 Um
 Okay I'll will give it an uh an eye .
 Okay . That's nice of you .
 Uh .
 Hey . Come on .
 Some leaf to eat .
 Okay . Yeah pretty good . Uh could you press the next uh
 The next ? Yes .
 Okay . Then uh .
 Yeah . Thanks .
 Here you go . Hmm .
 Yeah .
 Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other ?
 Yeah sorry , introduction and get acquainted and
 Uh
 Alright .
 That's the idea , so
 Uh . Your line broke .
 Yeah .
 Alright . It's not that fast . Yeah .
 Yeah it's a bit slow , so
 Yeah .
 I see . It misses the spot .
 pressure .
 I'm guessing a turtle .
 No . I'm kidding .
 I say good guess .
 Uh
 Why a turtle ?
 Because of its shell .
 Because it's slow . Yeah I was a bit slow too . So
 It's slow . You were slow too so
 'Cause it's so 'cause it's green .
 Dude you're a good drawer .
 Uh some other line uh width uh
 Do you have a turtle pet ?
 No .
 Uh okay .
 I dunno . Does it have legs ? Yeah ?
 Yeah yeah yeah .
 Yeah sure . Yeah not exactly legs but
 Stumpy stuff .
 More like fins or
 It's more like a tank .
 Yeah that's fins but I don't know where .
 They kind of l look like mole legs . With sharp nails on .
 Yeah .
 Some spots .
 Ah some eye .
 Yeah it's l looks very friendly .
 Yeah that's a fr friendly turtle I guess .
 Yeah well I think it's uh fair enough .
 Yeah okay .
 A little tail maybe .
 Right . I don't know what the position is .
 Does it have ears ?
 Uh no .
 No .
 No . Oh okay . Can you erase ears or Yeah ?
 No .
 The little holes maybe .
 Yeah yeah yeah . There's a a gum , gum to .
 Alright . Eraser .
 And why did you choose this animal ?
 So
 He said it was slow .
 I dunno . I it just came into my mind . So there's no particular reason I pen .
 Alright .
 I like it .
 Yeah .
 Well I'm guess I'm done . That's my turtle .
 Okay .
 Your turn Niels .
 Alright .
 How to select the next or here .
 The next yeah .
 Yeah . Here you go .
 Colours were under format right ? Let's see . How am I gonna do this ? Um
 Makes new paper .
 Yeah .
 Orange .
 Mm uh .
 A rabbit I think . Kangaroo .
 Kangaroo .
 Not quite actually .
 Fox .
 A fox yeah . Firefox .
 Dog .
 No . Aye .
 Cat .
 It's a cat . Not quite yet through .
 It's a cat .
 Mm .
 A cat who had an accident or
 Why a cat ?
 Uh yeah I dunno . They're my favourite pets .
 You have some uh ?
 Uh I have colour already .
 Yeah I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of st Oh shit . Um
 The pen , yeah .
 Excuse my language .
 Sure .
 I don't know how to draw its face . But you get the idea . It's a cat . It's my favourite uh pet animal , 'cause they're cute , they're independent and cuddly , I dunno . That's it . Or do I need to use more colours and
 Yeah . Alright .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Alright . Yeah .
 I think it's okay . You get idea right ?
**********
 Okay um we have a financial aspect to this project . Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros . Uh
 the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . Uh that's quite a big amount of money .
 And the production cost should be the half of the selling price .
 So we have to s
**********
 Okay now it's time for some discussion .
 Okay . What uh what uh do you want to discuss ?
 Uh
 Yeah .
 Yeah . We should get started .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 Uh I'm taking notes . Um
 Okay . Great .
 we each have a specific task , as I saw in my mail . I didn't know if you received the same mail . Yeah ? Okay so the um uh this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . Am I correct ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 I guess so . Yeah .
 True .
 Okay . Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions .
 Right ? Yeah ? And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements . Uh did any of you already do some work on this part or
 Yep .
 Yeah .
 Well I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . So I had to uh , I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , and kind of let it work in to get ideas about
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm . And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ?
 well how I have to fill it . Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional . And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said . How does the apparatus work ? And well I basically had two points .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy , and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . And that's basically all I have so far .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm . Okay .
 Yeah I got another point . It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo .
 Yeah . Wireless uh huh .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Alright .
 Yeah .
 So that's very common .
 Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function . You d you already told that . And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume .
 That are the the basic options for a remote control .
 Yeah .
 Yeah I kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions , 'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that . I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also . I dunno what the word is in English . Uh
 Okay , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 Yeah .
 Same I believe .
 Yeah .
 Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ?
 Uh well from a marketing uh perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements . Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market . I mean , what functions do they have . Um especially what are their shortcomings ? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ? So we can see uh what needs to be supported .
 Yep .
 Yes .
 Um and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? Um especially for future users , uh I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay . And you can get that information ?
 I think I can get that information , yeah .
 Okay . That would be very handy . Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ?
 So yeah .
 No n not specifically . More to how to get them and
 No ?
 I got some uh requirements it has uh it has to be user-friendly . Uh really easy to use buttons , not not uh very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons . It has to be a small unit . It has to be uh yeah , you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house . So it has n has not to be l yeah , gigantic uh machine .
 No okay .
 Yeah ?
 Yeah ?
 Of course .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Obviously .
 Big , mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Uh and a and a good uh zapping range .
 Uh what do you mean by that ?
 Yeah .
 Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be , uh yeah um yeah , quite a big distance . It has to be capable for zapping uh
 Yeah .
 From the other end of the room or something ? Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay um
 Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment .
 Um
 I think the best is to go to work .
 Whoa . Is that you or alright .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Any more points to discuss ?
 Yeah . I think
 we can go ahead with what we have . I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder .
 Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . And it seems you get more information by email .
 Alright .
 So that was it for me .
 Alright .
 Okay .
 'Kay . Thanks .
 Uh
 Are you going to put the the notes on the
 Yeah , in the project folder . Yeah . I'm writing very fast . Hope it's readable . Okay um anything more you want to add to the discussion ?
 Yeah . The pro okay .
 Okay .
 Alright .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Okay .
 Uh .
 Yep .
 I guess so .
 Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh
 Yeah . Do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ?
 session ?
 Yeah . Because then we have a
 After that we are going to the conceptual uh
 Yeah . Y you do some individual work , we have meeting , individual work , meeting . And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . And then I have to prepare uh I have to defend our design , so make it good . I depend on you .
 Yeah . We're just working the three phases .
 Yeah okay . We'll do our best .
 Okay . Better make it
 Okay .
 I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . Do we I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ?
 Yeah ? If you can mix it it's okay .
 Mm-hmm . Yeah .
 Yeah . That is my question also because like new new functions
 Yeah .
 Well I think that is the user
 Requirements . Yeah .
 requirements part . As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small
 Yeah . True .
 Yeah .
 But but we need good communication about this stuff , 'cause I have to f put the components into the design . So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard .
 Unit .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 I would first m
 Yeah well I I was
 Yeah I understand .
 Yeah . I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them . Yeah .
 Yeah well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video . And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . And then use your Windows media centre under your T_V_ with the same remote control . So with the switch , one single switch
 You can always add a few
 Yeah .
 Hmm , the C_D_ player . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah so
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . And you you don't need that for a T_V_ . And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , so I kind of need to know what we uh need .
 Okay .
 S
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah records and stuff like that .
 Okay .
 No .
 You need additional yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Uh
 Yeah .
 Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh
 Yeah .
 in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh
 In the project uh
 Yeah .
 Yeah . We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . And um reserve the possibility to add other features . So we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible . Yeah .
 meeting .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly . So it's hasn't it's yeah .
 Yeah .
 Alright .
 Th the least amount of functions possible so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Yeah . I understand . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah ? Okay and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to .
 Alright .
 Yes .
 Yeah .
**********
 Yeah , you're di dismissed . Not yet . Okay .
 Can we leave now or
 Half an hour .
 Thanks .
 You're fired . No .
 Mm .

 Let's see what we got to do .
 Yeah .
 See you later .
 Yeah see you later .
 Okay .
