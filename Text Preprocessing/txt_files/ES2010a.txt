 Okay . Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing . Um I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager . And I know all your names again , Courtney , Fenella and Amber . Alright . Okay , so first let's go through this PowerPoint .
 Yep .
 Yep .
 I wonder what button I press ?
 Just do it on the arrow .
 Yeah , or how about I just click ? Okay , here is our agenda for this meeting . Um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better . Um tool training , we're going to , I guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting .
**********
 Okay , here is our project . We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original , trendy and also user-friendly .
 And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um We're gonna have discuss the functional design first , how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate T_V_ , blah blah blah . And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . Same thing with conceptual design . Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . That's pretty much the the whole process for today . And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote .
**********
 Okay . Alright . First we're gonna start off by using our tools . And the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here .
 I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing .
 We could
 Yeah , we could on here .
 Alright , let's go forward then . Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . Even if you are not a good drawer like me . Alright .
 Artistic skills , nil .
 Fine .
 Um .
 Oh , thanks .
 Bless you .
 I draw like I'm in grade five .
 Oh do I .
 'Kay , about one more minute .
 Okay .
 Okay . And who would like to start us off ?
 I'll go . Um this is my picture . I drew fish I like fish , because uh , you know , their whole water-vascular system thing . It's pretty cool , and um they've got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes , sometimes vicious but that's okay . Yeah .
 Alright .
 Only if they're piranhas .
 Yeah , they they're easy , you know .
 Yeah .
 Alright . Who wants to go next ?
 I'll go . I drew a kitty . It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat , but I love cats .
 No I I see it . Yeah , it does look like a cat .
 No , I kne I knew .
 No , it looks like a cat .
 I love cats because they're independent , uh they pretty much know what they want , they get it , they move on .
 I love cats , too . I'm a cat person .
 Yeah .
 I'm allergic to cats . Oh , okay .
 Ah .
 Uh .
 I'm allergic to cats , too .
 If you're around one I had a roommate who was um allergic , but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it , you know , it's weird .
 In my next life .
 Yeah , yeah , if you're around them for a long period of time
 I still can't sleep with them in my room .
 Okay .
 Oh , yeah , this summer I , oh I had to live with cats . It was crazy . Yeah .
 Okay , Fenella ?
 Um , I drew a badger .
 Cool .
 Yay .
 Badger . Good choice . Why a badger ?
 Well , yeah . Uh
 I dunno , they're grumpy and nocturnal and
 Are you trying to suggest something ?
 Well , a little bit like the Yes . Um . And then , if you know Wind in the Willows badger . Yeah and then uh I don't know if you know Brian . He's Liverpudlian writer .
 Oh , okay .
 Alright .
 Um , that kind of books . Badgers are cool in that one too .
 No , that's good .
 You don't really have to , I mean , if you like 'em
 Okay . And I'm last . 'Kay . Look at my sad sad giraffe . No , no , no , it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur , but whatever . I don't know even much about giraffes , but I just love the way they look . They're just such odd creatures , you know . I I like that they're so unique and individual , I guess . I don't know much about their behaviour or anything , though . Only seen a couple in zoos . Yeah , but you can appreciate the way they look .
**********
 Okay . Alright . Guess we're getting straight back into business here . Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro , and our profit aim is fifty million Euro . We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia . And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote .
**********
 Okay . So we're gonna talk for a little while . Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . Expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote , anything that you can bring to the table for this project . So .
 Now ?
 Yeah . You wanna start us off ? Anybody have anything to offer ?
 Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote , right ? One remote for everything .
 Right .
 And everything being Wait , we have what , sound system , T_V_ , D_V_D_ , V_H_S_ , uh TiVo ?
 Right .
 Um .
 I think they'll be phasing V_H_S_ out shortly .
 Yeah , TiVo .
 TiVo .
 But it's still there , so
 Okay .
 if po if we're gonna do it
 It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal .
 They're never universal . That's right . Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , D_V_D_ player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the Yeah . Yeah . Something from Sam's club .
 Or if it's not like a Sony , if it's like a I don't know .
 So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals .
 Yeah .
 And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways .
 Yeah .
 'Kay , and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't Nobody wants to buy those any more . They want the ergonomic ones . Yeah . Ones that ones that look high-tech , too .
 They want like the flashy lights . Oh like this came from Las Vegas .
 But at the same time are simple .
 Mm yeah .
 Right . So that people like my mother can use it .
 What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ?
 Yeah .
 'Kay . Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that
 Just bad ones .
 Yeah . That's true .
 Um .
 What kinda battery would we want to use ? Because battery changing is usually Okay .
 D
 Double A_ .
 Double A_ .
 Do some of them use triple A_s though ?
 Yeah some use triple A_s . So double or triple ?
 Some but
 Okay .
 Yeah , I guess then it's
 If we need to do triple A_ we can , but most people usually have double A_s around .
 Okay . Yeah . But that has to do with the size of it too . Well , w as long as we know that issue is
 Right .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_ .
 Here we can
 Triple A . But it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important . Hey . Anything else ?
 Can you with a small lithium battery ?
**********
 Alright . Moving along .
 Oh , we're closing the meeting . Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes . Here's what we're going to do . Um the I_D_ , which is who ? Okay , you're going to think about the working design . What do you think that means ?
 Okay . And U_I_D_ , the technical fun functions design , making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things . Okay . And the marketing person , that's Courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification .
 Mm-hmm .
 I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for . Right ? I would think so . Okay . And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while . Okay , so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ?
 Right .
 Okay . This meeting is officially over .
