 Okay .
 Je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . It really looks like a banana .
 It is a banana .
 It is a banana .
 It is the essence of bananas .
 I would be confused with this thing .
 Mm .
 S
 Mm-hmm .
**********
 Okay . Hi . So we are here for the detailed design meeting .
 How is everyone ?
 Hi .
 Mm-hmm .
 So we will uh I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting .
 Then
 uh I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work . And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . Then we will uh evaluate the product .
 And uh end
 with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits
 with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not .
 Mm-hmm .
**********
 So d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say uh to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy ,
 Like a banana .
 and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera . And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros . So which is uh good , because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if ,
**********
 and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert .
 Yeah . Okay . So uh you can have my project in
 Yeah .
 You have a presentation ?
 Uh yeah just a
 Four .
 Participant four , yes .
 Evaluation .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Okay . So you can go . We can go through .
 Okay .
 So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings . So you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points . We
 Okay .
 we talked about before . So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points . Okay . So I go through all the uh all the points here , and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point . Okay ? And after we ha we have an an average , and uh we see .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay .
 The okay ? Uh so uh fancy look and feel , what do you think ? F between o one and seven .
 Okay . Maybe you can presen okay . Maybe hold it . So I think it's uh very uh very nice . What do you think ?
 I give it a I give it a five .
 Yeah .
 So it's between one and seven ? Seven is the highest uh ? I will give a six .
 Yeah .
 Seven is the
 I will give a a five .
 Mm-hmm .
 sorry .
 And you ? Do you vote uh Christine ? Do you also vote ?
 eh ? No , I just want to see something
 Maybe we all have to agree on a common
 Well , we can very easily .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh I think uh and need to as well .
 No problem . So this is your
 Need to uh I don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f
 If it's better or
 One is most .
 I
 Uh-uh .
 Um .
 Well , we can choose what we want . Okay , let's say that seven is the best .
 Yeah . Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm .
 Okay .
 So so do note the grade we have five , six for me , five . And what what's your choice ? How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ?
 Five .
 Oh sorry . Six
 Uh s you can how much what ?
 How much would you you don't answer to this uh questionnaire ?
 Oh yes I mm I dunno mm , I think six , it's a good uh
 So it will have five point five average .
 Five point five average .
 Yeah . Wa can . Okay . I sorry .
 Mm .
 Okay .
 Well , does it
 Okay . So after , the technological aspect ?
 Okay , techne technological aspect .
 So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel .
 Yeah , we have the wheel . We also have the rubber material ,
 Uh .
 which make it uh
 like
 new also . I think I would give a five .
 It's four .
 Four ?
 A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . The rubber is
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? No . Okay .
 Uh a four . I I
 No .
 So what's your uh grade ? Four ? So we have four , four f and five ?
 No .
 Four .
 We can put four ? Everyone is okay or four poin
 Yeah . For twenty five .
 Yeah , four .
 Four , yeah , let's put four .
 Four .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Doesn't it
 Very easy to use . Do you think it's easy to use ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I think so . Yeah . I would give a I would give a seven as well . It's very easy to use .
 I give a seven , I think .
 Six .
 Mm , six for me also .
 Six .
 So six point five .
 Six point five . Okay .
 'Kay .
 Six six six point five .
 Okay .
 Is it fashion ? Seven ?
 Oh yeah , its its f its fruit fruit shape . I would say seven . And is very very nice design .
 Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit , and we say that the yeah , seven .
 Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . Yeah .
 Yeah , seven .
 Yeah . Seven , okay .
 Yeah .
 Well , we hope .
 Easy to find .
 Uh easy to find in a room ?
 I lost my banana .
 I think you can't miss it .
 Yeah .
 Yeah ?
 Okay .
 Uh .
 Yeah , I think it's cool . I think we can put a six here .
 We have the lightning , or
 Yeah , we have the we don't sesh especially have the lightning but
 The lighting .
 So you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely , or
 So it's yellow . It's okay . I think it's very easy to I would say seven . It's hard to miss it .
 Yeah .
 Seven ?
 Six . Yeah , okay .
 Yeah .
 Is it is it robust ?
 Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , I think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control .
 Uh f yeah , it's ru it's rubber .
 Yeah .
 Yeah the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , they will , I don't know
 Yeah . But it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material . So maybe we can put a six .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , okay .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Everybody is okay , six .
 Six or five . Five .
 Six is okay ?
 Six , yeah , for me .
 Six .
 Yeah . Okay . S now um so .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Tadada .
 We have to sum up everything .
 Twenty .
 Thirteen uh , twenty , twenty six point five , uh seven , thirty two , thirty six . That's that's okay ?
 Thirty . Thir
 Six .
 Six is a good
 Okay .
 Good . Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better , and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product , I think .
 Yeah , the top
 Yeah , the be .
 Okay , so six is a
 Mm .
 So will become eight soon ?
 So it's a good evaluation , I think . It's very promising .
 Yeah , well it's a bit biased .
 We have a good price and uh .
 Huh .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Good .
**********
 So this prototype is quite nice .
 Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped , uh wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , uh quite big also , and they were selling something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Just a just a phone , wireless .
 Mm-hmm .
 So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive , I think .
 Yeah .
 I think the
 But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare .
 Yeah . Yeah , it's much more complex , but
 Yeah .
**********
 So , I think , we can summarise . So we have seen the prototype . It's very nice according to the work of our two designer . The the the financial aspect were okay . We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit .
 The the evaluation give satisfying result as well . So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting .
 So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party . I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff . Okay so congratulation .
 Start to eat banana .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay .
 Congratulations to the team . Uh very well , we worked together fantastically .
 Yeah .
 Nice product .
 Yeah .
 I think it was a good collaboration uh .
 So what does the management say ?
 Aspect .
 Sorry ?
 What does the management say ?
 I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well .
 Ah .
 All it depends on who watch this meeting . We don't know .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay , so good guys , so see you for next uh successful project .
