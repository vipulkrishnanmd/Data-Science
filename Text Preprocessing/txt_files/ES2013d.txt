 Um almost , there's one more thing I have to get out of the I have to make sure that this attachment will open .
 I keep forgetting whether I've done this . .
 Ah-ha .
 Okay .
 We'll open that when the time is right .
 In the meantime
 Closing things down , okay .
 Let's see what this thing does .
 Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? Ah , we came up together , we're good .
 Okay .
**********
 Are we ready to start ?
 Okay . It's now quarter of four . This is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five .
 Okay .
 Right . Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . We then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet , an Excel spreadsheet . And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . So we're going to make a very fast track . Okay .
 Um and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . So the first thing I have to do is close this so that I can get to
**********
 Where is it ?
 Red .
 I need to open mine .
 Not the agenda .
 Agenda three .
 Mm .
 No that th I want the minutes from the previous minutes . That should be there , minutes . Yeah . Okay . Uh from meeting three , is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show , just use it as is ? 'Cause this way I can more easily flip it .
**********
 Okay , um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , um each of you made your presentations .
 Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . Um we decided chip on print would be used . Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . Um looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling
 um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us .
 Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . And uh we closed as it ran out of time . Is that a fair presentation of what happened ? Okay , back to this meeting . Um we're down to the prototype presentation .
 Yes .
 Yep .
 Ta-da . Right .
 Alright .
 Over to you .
**********
 Well .
 Ooh , two .
 Yeah , well you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough . This is the one
 Ah .
 that I made .
 Uh-huh .
 It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . This is
 like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus . Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television . I mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television . Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that , but I'm sure it will work . Uh this is on off switch , 'cause I think we do need that , and I think it gives it a nice balance . And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . Um as for what it's actually made of well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right in the different menus .
 'Kay .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Uh position , I presume that just means
 right right on it , easy to see . The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . Right ? Form
 curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold .
 Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . Also with on off switch and infrared uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 So like uh well , I dunno , what's it like ? I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth .
 Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons .
 So we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . And what we
 well , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it .
 Uh material yeah , that's what I have to say about material .
 Can I scroll down on there and see what else
 Mm-hmm .
 Well colour , I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that's the company colours , but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well .
 So , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if I'm yeah , maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them .
 Um well I don't have very much to add .
 Um the the case oops , that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . We have the technology to do that . Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture . We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . Um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , it's the stalk of the banana , or it's just the thing at the end of this version . Um so that's for material .
 Colour , well uh Steph's the expert on colour . Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that .
 Yeah , I think that's all we've got to say really .
 I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . This one has n banana , yeah . This one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded ,
 A banana .
 it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like yeah , you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image . 'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and
 Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ?
 Hold them , you see , you know . Curvature , is it to your liking ?
 Oh I see , the on-off's in the back .
 Yes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it .
 If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all .
 And then you can use your thumb .
 And it was partly we thought the design looked better , but it could be moved if if marketing feel it's important to have the on off button in a different place .
 Yeah .
 I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the
 Breaking , oh right . Well you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid .
 you know yeah .
 I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role .
 Hmm .
 It's really kind of a
 Yeah , we really like we really like that design , I mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . Like a c like a compass point , you know , just up , down , left and right , and we think we could make that quite a good feature . And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel , but better . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , I mean it that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , I was try I was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? It's texting .
 Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
 Yeah . But it's also like texting , you don't
 Hmm .
 Yeah .
 And it's a very simple design , there's not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make .
 It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different . You know , I I d I have several four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to you know , this is really identifiable .
 Hmm .
 Yeah .
 I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , but we do definitely think that it's a viable option .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
**********
 Okay . The next item is evaluation .
 No , okay .
 Uh if that's if you're finished .
 Um
 Uh yeah , we're finished .
 Mm-hmm .
 shall I take your uh power ?
 Oh sorry .
 Oh .
 Try again .
**********
 Okay . This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . So , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers
 a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and I've made a list of criteria to look at , and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the um the board .
 Okay . So um
 fancy ,
 technologically innovative ,
 easy to use , trendy ,
 buttons ,
 excess buttons , good buttons ,
 ugly ,
 sellable ,
 and other . And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , like they overlap .
 Yeah , what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials .
 Mm , yeah , price .
 Hmm .
 We'll put price up at the top .
 Not that we actually know anything about it , but we can we can pretend .
 Well we will soon , unfortunately .
 Um
 Okay , so
 Come on .
 No
 Did you say ?
 Uh okay , so
 , .
 wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ?
 It depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when I think of fancy , I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like
 baroque curliness and which
 Mm-hmm .
 I'd call these quite uh minimalist ,
 Yes , a plain , simple , clean design .
 simple and plain , but I mean I do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , so in that respect it is quite fancy .
 Mm-hmm .
 I yeah , so in that respect I think we'll go with that respect .
 I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , I'd say maybe aesthetic .
 Yeah .
 Well we have got s trendy further down , but
 Elegant .
 Elegant .
 Elegant .
 Elegant , I don't know if I'd call them elegant .
 Yeah , no these aren't the exact terms that the um
 like stylish or aesthetic .
 Yeah .
 Stylish , yeah .
 Elegant . We're gon let's use elegant , although the the the people , the word on the street is is
 Fancy .
 Yeah . N that um
 Did you just break the pen ?
 yeah uh the uh is fancy . So let's let's take it to the next level .
 Well d we'll just call it fancy then .
 Well okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy .
 we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow ? Should we go with the yellow in terms of I think that's a really superior they're both
 Yeah , I think we n we need to they're both yellow with black buttons , it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that , but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two that isn't that is more curved , like a banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , so .
 Yeah .
 As a banana .
 I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana .
 Yeah .
 And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , but I I do like the chunk .
 The chunk .
 So that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , is it . Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two .
 No , but I mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them .
 Unless do you guys wanna evaluate both ?
 I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true .
 Yeah , I'd
 It's more true than false , about a two .
 Okay .
 So we say true .
 Um
 technologically innovative .
 I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept . I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative .
 Yeah . So we'll say we'll say uh false .
 Easy to use .
 Very .
 Yes .
 One , is that inappropriate ? Okay . Oh , pardon me . Um
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Trendy .
 trendy , s and I say specifically spongy fruity .
 Oh yes .
 Mm-hmm .
 Well , maybe only a two or a three then , 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific
 We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . I think yeah .
 Hmm .
 Okay .
 Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work , but
 Okay , so two ? Um
 Yeah .
 Excess buttons . No .
 are there excess buttons ?
 No .
 No .
 That is false . Um good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons .
 So that's false .
 Better , more intuitive buttons , yes .
 True .
 Ugly .
 No .
 No .
 No .
 People don't respond well to ugly .
 Sellable , uh quirky , you know , something people like oh , yeah . Yeah , I do too .
 Yeah , I think they're different , aren't they ?
 Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think .
 I like it .
 It could be quite a good brand , like
 Oh yeah .
 a good little object .
 And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving ?
 With the
 Oh , we also need tho think about the energy . Is it the kinetic energy ? If it's it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy .
 Yeah , with the energy .
 Mm . Yeah .
 It is going to be kinetic ?
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro .
 Uh so yes .
 Yeah , but we haven't
 completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely sure about that , but yeah .
 Well you're still in the Play-Doh stage . Anything else ? Including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ?
 Yeah .
 Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there .
 Okay .
 Yes , the instinct says true .
 So true one or should I go to two or three ?
 I'd put it at one I think , but I dunno , what do you
 Okay .
 I would say maybe a two , 'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus
 Yeah , true , it might be the yeah , yeah , true .
 and things . I mean it's not just like I mean it's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different , whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in . uh we need somebody to develop that .
 Yeah , that's not a cheap thing to get .
 True .
 Hmm .
 Yeah , that's a good point .
 Um
 other ? Anything else you guys can thing of ?
 And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that 'cause I have to do an average . And then um excess buttons .
 Yeah .
 Right .
 Just putting no excess buttons .
 Exactly .
 Wow we're doing really well .
 Yeah , be you know , so it doesn't ruin the polarity .
 As for see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition
 Mm-hmm .
 but but we are at the upper end of the push button market .
 Or L_C_D_ .
 Yeah .
 Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . If not I'll average those .
 I think we're good .
 Okay .
**********
 Mm .
 Okay . We're a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance .
 So
 Okay .
 Um okay , how about if I uh pass this back to you and I'll uh figure out the average here .
 Yep .
 Right .
 Thank you for everyone's help with that .
 Right .
**********
 And as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank Goodness .
 And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me . Um
 and
 it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device .
 Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells .
 Okay .
 Well , just kinetic then , .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Um
 what's a hand dynamo ?
 That was the crank , wind-up crank on the side .
 It's the wind-up .
 Oh shoot , forget that . Kinetic is um and how many of those will we need per we only need one .
 Just one .
 Okay . Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those .
 Uh uh yeah , I think we can do it all with simple
 Just checking that .
 Yeah , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest .
 Okay , and we only need one of those . Okay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . It looks like it single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness . It's that's uh uh one .
 Yep .
 Yeah , that that one is single curve , isn't it ? Um do we have
 What does double curved mean , I don't understand .
 And that's
 I I think you it means you reverse the curve .
 uh that's the the one that goes like this .
 Oh no , we don't need that . No .
 Yeah . Yeah , I do I don't think we need that for either of them , you can do a banana in single curve , yeah .
 Right .
 Single-curved , I'd say .
 No , single curve .
 Okay , case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . We had the special colour .
 I
 I just wanna say plastic .
 And did we say plastic ?
 Yeah , can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , but it depends on the cost , I guess .
 One , two , three , four , five , six .
 Yeah .
 Okay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are . Interface button push button interface . That's what we're using , isn't it ?
 It's just button .
 Yeah .
 Yes .
 Yep . Do we need to say how many buttons , or
 Yeah .
 Whoops , don't want that , not yet . Um
 or d is it just one ?
 No , it just says push button interface . Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black .
 'Kay .
 And the buttons
 Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ?
 Uh they'll be rubber , yep .
 So we need one of them .
 And are they any special form ?
 Well yeah , like the compass point one .
 Actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 'Cause I think they can be plastic .
 'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top .
 Yeah . They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , because we haven't got a double curved case .
 Oh .
 Yeah , they could be plastic .
 Okay .
 Um
 let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement .
 It's just one , isn't it ?
 Uh we only need one of them .
 Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed .
 What , we're in .
 Yeah .
 We're in . That's us .
 More profit .
 Great .
**********
 Okay , I'm going to save this into our
 desktop , project documents . Okay .
 As our project document bit .
 Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ?
 Yeah .
 There we are .
 Yes .
 That's the only Excel document that will be in there , so it's there for all of us . Okay , so , are they under twelve fifty ? Yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide . Right .
**********
 Um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity .
 Yeah , leadership ,
 Sure .
 Yeah .
 teamwork ,
 Yes .
 means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things .
 And Play-Doh .
 Uh-huh .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought .
 Yeah well , 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . So much better just to go and ,
 you know , this is it , this is what we want .
 Yep .
 Okay .
 So , we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above .
 Yep .
 Um did we find any new ideas ?
 I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I that really opened my eyes .
 Yeah . Spongy .
 I I only speak for myself though .
 And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , so . Good work as a design team , because we
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I think we're a good team actually .
 I'm not sure all the wires are really great though .
 So we actually worked well as a group .
 I thought so .
 Right . Are the costs within the budget ? Yes . Is the project evaluated ? Yes .
 Oh yes .
 Yes .
 Yes .
 Yes .
 Yes . Oh hang on , we haven't heard .
 I can give you a number , um it's uh the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , I can I can spell it out . There were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two . I would say that's ex excellent
 Uh-huh .
 in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place .
 Yeah . And the the only false one is because we've chosen
 To maintain old technology , exactly .
 to keep a simple old technology , which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , so .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Absolutely , and it's kept us within budget .
 Yes .
 Yeah . So we do count as I think excellent or one .
 Mm-hmm .
**********
 Alright . And we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present , um and then we're done .
 .
 Okay .
 We done good , and we're finished in time .
 Bring on the ice sculptures .
 Nice .
**********
 And then we get the product launch party . Product launch party ? Absolutely .
 So we might have to wait .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 That's what I said , ice sculptures .
 Um I one thing I want to do is oh , I think the meeting's done .
 Is that the end of the meeting ?
 I believe that is the end of our meeting . Thank you , Melissa .
 Yeah .
**********
 Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files , because I don't think everything is saved .
 The right files . Final meeting market
