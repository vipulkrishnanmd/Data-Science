 Okay . Uh door is closed . Well , let's begin . Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we'll have to hurry up . Um well I'll start with the presentation again , the agenda .
 I'm listening .
 Right .
 Great .
 Yo .
 So . Uh This one I think . Uh yeah . Well alright .
 Um well , I'll show you the notes . It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting , but I'll show them . We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . Um
 Then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take . So this time we exactly know what to decide about . And then we'll close again .
 Mm-hmm .
 Alright , great .
 Alright .
 Uh
 Well these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later . We'll first look at your uh presentations . Alright ?
 Mm-hmm .
**********
 Walter will uh start again this time ?
 Yeah , great .
 Yo .
 Alright , Trendwatch .
 'Kay .
 Right .
 I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do . Uh the trends . It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling .
 'Kay .
 Uh this because of our last model was very functional , but it uh people didn't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . That's uh something you uh have to take a look at . And uh the feeling has to be very great . Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great .
 Mm-hmm . Alright .
 Alright .
 Um there's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . This is uh two times as less important , and uh same for this one . Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too .
 Less .
 Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier . So we have to have uh something like that , like we uh
 Well , yeah .
 L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts .
 Right . Uh the last point is easy to use . Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that .
 Yeah ?
 Easy to use ? I think that's your ta
 Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . Well we have to choose one of them .
 Yeah , I know .
 I think we have to go for the first one . It's the most important one . So we have to uh take that one .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Okay .
 So it it it isn't very important that that it works easy . But it has to look great .
 Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use .
 Yeah . We'll we'll look at uh .
 We'll see .
 You Yeah . Yeah , yeah , you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use It's not a very comp complicated device .
 Yeah , right .
 Alright .
 'Kay .
 But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow , that's real great uh great concept .
 Old people . So , that's it for me .
 Alright . Nice ,
 Alright . Uh these are the new colours of this year . So it must be very bright , very colourful . People like this .
 So we we have to think uh in this direction . So i set your mind to it . Findings ? Fashion update ? Fruit and vegetables are cool . I am told .
 So
 Well
 Uh you think ?
 The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables . So we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way . Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong . I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it , maybe in a colour or something , that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong . And that's uh also for the younger public .
 Yeah , well
 Bananas .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 B
 Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . Th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different .
 Yeah , that's great . But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin . So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily .
 Yeah .
 Yes .
 Mm .
 Yep , alright .
 Well , the don'ts . Older people like dark colours and simple shapes . Well we don't want uh older people , we want young people . So uh we're gonna turn that around . We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours . Right ? Okay .
 Alright .
 Wood is popular . Aha .
 We don't want wood .
 Yeah yeah yeah .
 Yeah , among the old people , yeah .
**********
 uh well show us .
 Yeah ?
 Sports uh , they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh Huh ? That's nice .
 Soccer fronts . Mm .
 Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design .
 Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties . This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . And the materials ? Um I have heard several things , so I uh I'll have to change that on the way .
 But uh the case ? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong . It should feel strong . So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient . We should move to uh something
 Yeah , we should change that .
 Well maybe it it it is , but it doesn't look strong . So maybe
 Well yeah . Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So
 No no no .
 But we still have to look at our price of course . Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh
 Yeah . Also Yeah .
 Mm-hmm . But we'll return to that . Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . The chips made of silicon , I guess . I think that's the best uh way to do it . And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb .
 Then I've uh had a few findings , made a few findings . Uh the target audience product style . Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that .
 They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . But of course that's not our uh things this . So this is things we must not do . And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people , which is of course our uh group , the people we aim at . Um under forty five years old . Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours .
 Yes .
 Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . But they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that . And
 Mm . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 also they like curved round shapes . So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh
 discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that .
 Mm .
 Hmm .
 Well I also have um
 All the results ?
 We keep coming back to the fronts .
 Yeah .
 several examples of uh styles , so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean .
 Yeah .
 Uh these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Hmm ?
 Yeah , alright .
 It was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking , but that's n that's not what we want . We have these kind of things . I don't know what exactly they are . It looks like Well you know uh you recognise the shapes , it's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes . You also uh see uh this device , it's not very round and Fruity of course . Yeah , it uh That's true .
 Mm-hmm . Nai . Uh no .
 Hmm .
 Fruity . Fruity .
 It's t terrible . Alright .
 And uh well round shapes , primary colours . You can see it all here . And of course uh this famous device . I think as you know something uh some devices like this . So to give you an idea of uh
 Well it's got a strong look , this . Yeah .
 This has a strong look . Although it's plastic , it's it's grey to to to give it iron look . That's uh
 Yeah , it still has a strong look .
 Yeah . And it's round .
 But then you are losing your fruity colours .
 Yeah . Well we have to make a
 Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . So uh those kind of things you can you can combine .
 That's true .
 Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control . I don't think that's very practical , but But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour . Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger . 'Cause if you look at this , it it doesn't look very very strong , becau But this is plastic , and and this too , but
 No , it isn't .
 Okay .
 Yeah but the
 Yes .
 But it doesn't have to look strong . The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . The feel .
 The feel ? Uh alright . Well
 So , if you ti
 And it it doesn't have to be strong , also . Only the feel .
 Well
 Nah yeah the feel
 You you Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . So it it looks pretty but it feels strong .
 Right .
 Mm-hmm .
 Oh .
 I agree .
 And I Then I have some more findings . Um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device , uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun .
 And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote , that's a bit , oh , that's a bit uh
 No titanium .
 That's a bit uh much . And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . That that's the information I received . If you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you
 What do you exactly mean with double curved ?
 can't use titanium . Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look . And uh now the the shape , yeah , a curved case . Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . Uh a more modern look not plain , long box style , but
 I dunno .
 Double curved ?
 I'll draw it , but maybe later . And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh . Um anyway
 Yeah . Yeah .
 It it mean Yeah , well okay .
 Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive .
 And , uh as we agreed , we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh speech uh controlled device . Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . But
 Yeah right .
 Well
 It's worth the trouble I think , because
 The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material .
 Because people like that .
 This soft material thing from uh Yeah .
 Uh rubber is a soft material , I guess . Uh soft enough .
 So that's uh basically what I want to talk about .
 Yeah . Right .
 Yeah . Right . Yeah .
 Alright . Okay . We will take that .
**********
 And then uh Mike ?
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier .
 Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . Um we must decide where , this meeting . Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . And um well they're cheap , so we could use them now .
 Oh
 Um it's not really speech recognition , it's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the
 That's interesting .
 the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that .
 Oh , yeah , I understand . Yeah .
 Oh okay .
 Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function .
 Right .
 No it doesn't does not do anything . But i it's just a Yeah it's it's cheap .
 No .
 Oh .
 That's a bit uh
 But that that makes it cheap . It's it's just a an extra function , and it's cheap .
 Yeah .
 Yes . I understand . But it has no functionality for our remote at all .
 No but
 No but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks .
 Yeah , right . Young people love them .
 But it it's n nice for young people . They like gadgets . Yeah .
 Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think . Um
 Yeah , ple
 Right .
 If it's cheap . Yeah .
 Hmm .
 Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff
 um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that .
 So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ?
 Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . A voice recognition can be uh implemented .
 And uh I drew an example , but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do . Hmm ? Well I have the I can draw it again , and I know what I did wrong . I didn't tick the note bo box in the . Um
 Alright . How How
 Can you draw it now of uh Can you draw it now ?
 Ah .
 Mm . Alright .
 How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ?
 Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the
 Alright . So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down .
 Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen .
 But then we should also have an uh an Okay button .
 Yeah right .
 Yes .
 Um I shall draw this . If it uh works .
 button , yeah .
 Just uh There is already a blank . Yes ? So Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm so have I .
 Nah .
 .
 You have to push hard .
 I suggest a banana shape .
 Yeah .
 Because of the fruity uh fashion .
 Yeah .
 No m Next year that's out .
 Yellow and
 Yeah alright , yeah . Just a hunch .
 Huh .
 Mm no .
 Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh
 Yeah .
 Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ?
 correct .
 Yeah just uh the numbers .
 And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ?
 These these will be bigger in the the real design .
 Alright , yeah .
 This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen . And with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus and that can
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Um the video button should be uh an apart button , because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click .
 You've
 Yes .
 Right .
 And what's the menu button ?
 And you you need a you need a speaker .
 Um it's
 For the
 Hmm ?
 This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus Well we we can add another button here , but
 But how did How do you get out of the menu then ? Yeah .
 Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . Uh
 Uh by pe pressing the menu button again . By pressing the menu button again , you go uh out . It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yes , well but bec because when you push Menu you get in , and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice . And
 Yeah ? Yeah ?
 Ah right . Well you you
 Yeah . But you can men you can press menu again to get out .
 Well that's also the Okay button . That's you you should have uh
 No no , we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button and this the Okay button .
 No .
 Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out .
 Exit .
 Exit .
 Ah once you have an extra Menu button , you don't need that that extra option . You have uh redundancy .
 Well , it's just a choice .
 This is my suggested design . Um Yes .
 But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . Or don't
 Yeah , if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should .
 Why would you put it uh then , and where is the recording uh the microphone ? Where would you put it ?
 Well they that could be anywhere . That's very small . It could be uh down here .
 Uh-huh .
 Um . Well , not here . I yeah I suggest here . But that's just a little gap . Yeah .
 Right , and spea speaker at the back , or something .
 Microphone , yeah .
 Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy .
 Yeah I understand . Uh but uh we could uh d do , but it's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something .
 Alright .
 Yeah .
 Well i
 Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they won't be uh very expensive . But
 Huh ?
 Alright .
 Alright .
 Yeah ? Okay .
 Well , okay , alright . Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make .
 And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . But
 I'd I agree .
 Yeah , fine . Move on .
 Fine .
 Well yeah yeah yeah .
 Yeah .
 Oh , um I had some uh examples . You can uh
 I can live with it .
 Yes ?
 But
 I did not like it very much , but
 Well these are
 Too big .
 quite obvious , very ugly remote . Um
 Yeah .
 They do they don't look fruity enough .
 Nei They're n they're not trendy .
 No , well th
 They're all black .
 Yeah . Well not all .
 Hey , that one I like .
 Uh this is for children but th
 Tho Yeah those
 It doesn't look strong .
 No .
 No .
 But it doesn't uh the
 W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to .
 The remote .
 Yeah right .
 Yeah , ok Yeah .
 Well this is a terrible
 Terrible .
 This is just crazy .
 But it it must not look too childish of course huh ?
 It's it's all too much buttons . Too many buttons . That's
 Um this looks Yeah . This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens . I think we should , if it's um possible , uh one with colours , but
 Nah th It's too expensive . Yeah .
 I don't know uh Too expensive ? Alright .
 Well , that's too expensive I think .
 Well Nah .
 But it Yeah .
 Alright . Yeah .
 Okay .
 Ha , even more . N
 But are we going for a strange uh form ?
 'Kay .
 No , not very strange .
 'Cause people like that .
 Not not too strange . No .
 Not too strange . You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is .
 It still has t
 Yes . Th a a kind of bridge . So it f falls over the hand .
 I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms , s something like that .
 Well
 Yeah ? Yeah ?
 Yeah .
 You know ?
 Well I have at home a remote with a bridge . It's just a half round half half circle at And then it falls exactly over the hand , and that's very nice . That's It feels comfortable .
 Yeah , but people like something uh new you know . Yeah , different . Y yis
 Exotic yeah . We have t Yeah , yeah . I will design it , we design it later . So we'll get to that later I guess .
 Yeah .
 Alright . Great .
 Yeah , alright .
**********
 Um where did I put it ? Um conceptual phase , I think this is it .
 The specific shape . The
 I got this from our friends . So Uh yeah the conceptual design .
 Our sources .
 These are a few examples which we have to decide about . All the the materials from the case , uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story .
 Um
 Your bag .
 Yeah . Um now from the user interface , your uh package ? Um where No well , that's more like the buttons where they have to come . And um
 B a bit of , yeah well , a bit of uh design .
 Yeah , this is what we've just done . Right ?
 But uh we should decide now .
 Yes , but we have to decide about these now . And uh the trend-watching . So as you said , fruity is in , well sells good . Wow . Uh these things .
 Ah right .
 Yeah . Materials are the most , most impor
 Yeah .
 So we have to uh put it in one uh document .
 Uh yes . Um so if we uh go through them
 Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document , and then uh put the answers after the subjects . Yeah .
 Not everything .
 Well we have to decide all these things ?
 Yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine .
 Yeah well uh
 W we can uh override them ?
 Why should I uh
 Yeah .
 So
 Okay . And well the the electrical cable is just normal uh .
 Cop copper uh material .
 Well a case ? Uh that's me . Uh I suggest Well what do I suggest actually ?
 What what kind of properties should it have ? Well we just listened .
 Uh s solid , yeah . Yeah .
 I think we Why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front . That
 Do you know the new uh
 Just like um most cell phones are .
 Yeah , I understand . Yeah . So we have titanium .
 No no
 The front is the most important .
 Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , to give that uh strong look . And then the front is made of plastic . And you can put that on and off , and switch it .
 Yeah .
 You know what ?
 Yeah .
 But the feel of plastic isn't strong .
 No but you have titanium of course . Uh you have the best of both worlds .
 No but you you have this Yeah .
 Yeah alright , alright . 'Kay .
 Yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this . So you feel titanium .
 And of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end . But you also have the titanium .
 Yeah . Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas
 Yeah .
 Yeah of course , but yeah you have to make a
 And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to .
 decision .
 Yeah , but it it's expensive .
 I guess so . Uh titanium I sh I think uh
 Yeah .
 Bendable . Bendable .
 Huh ? Well , well the
 Well any colour
 According to my sources , uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh Titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want .
 Yeah , then you you paint it in the colour you want it . The plastic is is the colour you want it .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Paint spray .
 Mm .
 Yeah alright .
 So Yeah .
 So , we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ?
 Alright .
 I've uh
 Yeah , I think that's a nice trade-off .
 Mm .
 Titanium back , plastic front . Okay . Um well I am going to put it in here , uh because we can uh look . I Um solid feel and trendy look . So material , um hard plastic for the front ?
 Yeah , great .
 Yeah .
 Alright .
 Yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back .
 Yeah .
 For the non-removable uh part .
 But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you can't switch it . When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match . You know ?
 Well but
 Well titanium is neutral .
 The titan titanium isn't isn't v very Yeah , i it doesn't uh curves . No uh I nei . Titanium is very No no no , but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . I dunno if if you disagree , but I think it's doesn't matter very much .
 I understand . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah .
 Hmm .
 Yeah .
 Alright .
 Well
 Yeah . Alright .
 Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours , and they don't use uh wood .
 Funky customers . Alright .
 And even if it does uh doesn't match , it will uh People like mm colours that don't match .
 Mm . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Excuse me ?
 The electrical cable uh does
 It's uh from uh our coffee uh
 Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh
 No we don't use an electrical cable . Yeah inside , but this is for the coffee uh machine .
 Yeah in
 Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh
 Of course .
 Yeah , but that's not what's meant here , I think .
 Nei .
 So external .
 Oh external ? Well A coffee grind doesn't have Na ja . Never mind the coffee grind .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Well uh all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard
 work . So
 Right ?
 The chip is normal silicon . Uh the buttons are normal , etcetera . Okay ? So that's just easy . Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier uh remotes . The conceptual specification of the user interface ?
 Alright . Mm-hmm .
 Um well we have our beautiful drawing .
 Alright .
 Well I got a better one here and I will um
 Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder , and then I'll put it in our end report .
 The shared folder .
 I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting .
 Yes , you can
 Yeah yeah yeah
 Mm yeah . You can uh put some uh which button is what .
 Okay . Um the trend-watching
 .
 included these days . And what do we ? We thing that fruit and bright colours are
 Yeah the the the front w
 I think we can launch a couple of packages . You can buy a different kind of of of machine , but it's the same thing , but with another front . So
 Yeah .
 Yes . We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot . Uh those kind of things .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah that's the whole idea of the front .
 And you can you can
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yes . But that's for later on . The fronts y you can do anything with them .
 Yeah right .
 Yeah .
 Yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like iPod mini
 Yeah , right For the uh initiative uh launch .
 Yeah .
 For the for the launch , yeah .
 It's good marketing .
 Mm .
 Launch different lines at once .
 So e th then a c couple of basic colours . Not not very uh sim Not
 Yeah , n not too heavy . You can always take another pick .
 Yeah .
 We should not give them the m the most lovely front
 They have to buy it later on . Yeah right . More basic . Yeah .
 when they buy it for the first time . Yeah . Come on . We still have to make those fifty million , yeah ? .
 Yeah .
 Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
 Very boring , yeah . The most boring fronts possible .
 Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so , so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more . Yeah .
 The most ugly .
 Yeah , right .
 Two .
 Yeah but you you can have some basic colours , and then we come with the special patterns on them , and and uh And uh
 Red red , blue and green you give them or something , and then you can give them uh other ones .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Alright .
 Um well the buttons etcetera , we get from Mike . Uh this fruit and bright colours , yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour , we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch , when we uh well introduce our remote .
 Uh we still have to make We have still have to make the es the the real basic design . Because yeah we have the sketch but
 Yeah . But we we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing . Else it w won't sell . So
 Yes .
**********
 Yes . Well I'll have to , before I get another warning for five minutes , I'm going to get
 Alright , yeah .
 Where is my mouse ? Uh where is my mouse ?
 Lost my mouse .
 Oh yeah . Um this is it .
 Unbelievable .
 Well , um this we have . Uh basic stuff . Interface we have . Supplements , L_C_D_ . Maybe a a cheap voice recording .
 Yeah .
 Well Yes . Alright . Individual actions .
 Yeah we should do that .
 The price ?
 We all agree on that . Yeah .
 Mm .
 Industry designer , . User Interface , Mike . You're going to work together
 on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .
 Yeah , we can do that .
 Together or uh Yeah together . How Yeah yeah , but how do I
 Yeah togeth
 That's what I got uh to hear .
 But bu we stay we stay here or something ?
 Yes well we'll get it to hear that I think . But I think so . Th they're saying SMARTboard and that's it
 You can take the SMARTboard .
 Ah right . And take it to our rooms and uh
 This is the SMARTboard , so
 Um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype , and y Well that's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera .
 Ah , specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .
 Yeah . So you'll get it on your em on your laptop . Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project yeah project evaluation . So um
 Have fun . 'Kay .
 Some
 Some non functional tasks .
 , what are you going to do ? Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means , but uh you'll get uh the specifications .
 We don't have produ product yet , so kind of difficult .
 Yeah . That's why I uh
 But uh
 You're fired . No but
 How long do we still have ?
**********
 Well , can we talk about something else ? Uh
 Yeah .
 Uh no I don't know anything , but maybe uh anyone else uh Yeah ?
 Ajax . Nah .
 Yeah . Um
 Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ? Yeah I I I also uh thought Yeah .
 Um round . Yeah . Round .
 Round I think .
 To make it as uh as round as possible .
 And these uh these s these buttons uh are more uh triangle-ish shaped with a square one in the middle . Yeah . Yeah .
 Why does
 Curvy . Yeah . So you can see you have to up or down .
 Ah f fuck you .
 But now I see the
 And this must be uh volume I think , and this programme .
 Heh ?
 Mm .
 We can't get
 Well most of the time uh up and down is programme and left and right are volume , I think .
 Well th th th th th that depends uh .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , it depends , but
 Well we uh
 If you turn up the volume , you always see this thingy go up .
 We we j we'll just give them an uh We'll design it , and then they can give comments on it .
 Yeah , that's right .
 Yeah . Yeah alright .
 Yeah . Okay .
 Ts It doesn't work any more . We can't save them . So we'll just have them uh standing there .
 Yeah , I noticed .
 You can't uh click the corners .
 No . It's a bit uh bit a pity . Well we still have uh more than five minutes . Um
 It's a real real great thing .
 So what are we going to do ?
 I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue . Oh we can uh decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote .
 Let's start the design .
 I think I'm going to buy it .
 We want it . And it's only f twenty five Euros . Come on . No that's nothing .
 Yeah , this is the front .
 Well yeah . Um I think um a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be Yeah , why not ? If there's enough space , you can put uh We'll we'll
 Mm .
 Also the slogan ? On the
 Uh I I'd say only the logo .
 O
 Yeah . Me too .
 Too much text and it gets too too busy .
 Well , our slogan is not very long . It's just a simple What is it ?
 Well it's quite a long phrase .
 We put the fashion in electronics .
 We put the fashion in electronics .
 But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion
 You c
 with our fronts . So
 But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part . The logo and the and the
 Yeah , right .
 Ah the logo should be on the top I think .
 The logo
 On the top . Yeah . Well in in in the right top corner ? And well you c On the back , you can put uh h At the bottom , you can put the logo with the
 Yeah they do . Well yeah .
 Yeah .
 Right corner , yes .
 Right corner , or maybe here in the middle ?
 uh the text ? Yeah . Uh yeah , at the back ?
 Yeah . Just just small .
 But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front .
 Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board , and you can remove the front .
 Well you c Well uh Yes . You can The logo can be on on every uh front .
 Yeah well
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah , but you can scratch it off or something . It's better if you have it uh
 Yeah , but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something .
 Carved into the material .
 No , you you can carve it into the titanium at the back .
 I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing . But am I the only one , or uh
 Yeah , on the backside . Well n n not not on the front side , I think . On the back Yes , you you can , yeah , push that in , so that it is always be there .
 Well , management would like it .
 The front side , no no l no slogan .
 No not on the front , but on the backside . Uh
 Sorry .
 I think it's a nice idea , to make it more recognisable , that the next to the logo you have the slogan .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 I agree .
 To make more uh of an impression .
 But not too big .
 Just uh Yeah .
 Not too big . No , very small . Not on the entire back , but uh just very small . But readable enough of course .
 Okay .
 Yes , slogan from
 But we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design .
 company
 Yeah I think over here the logo .
 Lo Uh yeah . Or maybe here in the middle , but we'll decide later .
 on the back
 with logo and
 logo also on
 the front but not exchange uh
 Uh ? Hmm ? Uh when
 changing fronts .
 Alright , that's decided .
 Do you do you see a bit of the of the um
 Five minutes left .
 of the uh titanium ? O on the front ? Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium , the front is the the upper part , and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen . So
 Yes we could
 So a bit of titanium between ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah . No no betwe of between we can do but But then you have two parts of front , two fronts that
 That's a bit Oh that that's that's pretty cool .
 No , they have two fronts , that . You you can Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
 No no no no . You have to make this titanium too .
 No ?
 This enti entire bottom ?
 Else you you get problems with the L_C_D_ . Like dust in it and so things like that . When you exchange all the fronts and it's open .
 Yeah .
 Yes .
 Yeah .
 I already have uh all kinds of uh
 No , you can you can just And then not a straight line but uh some sort of wave or something . This is titanium . And this is uh
 filth between the mobile .
 And then the lower part is titanium ?
 I think that's nice , yeah .
 Yeah . Some some kind of wei weight in it . Yeah .
 Yeah . Round forms .
 F front .
 Yeah .
 I like that bit of uh titanium also on the uh
 Yeah . With the with the curved edge .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 A bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone . Maybe you can show it . It also has the those two distinct uh
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Tada .
 Mm bit like this . Uh it's uh
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , you can make it go
 round this corner too where the logo is . Because it has to be uh there all the time you know .
 What ?
 Yeah yeah . That uh Yeah . Maybe a nice touch , yeah .
 Ah .
 So uh a little corner of titanium .
 So round where ?
 Yeah , that's nice finishing touch you need .
 Oh , yeah .
 Yes , that also sounds uh pretty uh neat .
 So this this is the exchangeable part .
 This is the
 That's a bit too much , but No , no no no , but I think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually . Of course , because it's my design but No our d our design , alright .
 The Phillips remote uh costs more .
 Right .
