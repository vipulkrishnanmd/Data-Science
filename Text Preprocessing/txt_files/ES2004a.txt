 Hmm hmm hmm .
 Are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ?
 Yeah .
 Okay , that's fine .
 Am I supposed to be standing up there ?
 So we've got both of these clipped on ?
 Okay .
 She gonna answer me or not ?
 Yeah , I've got
 Right , both of them , okay .
 Yes .
 God .
 Jesus , it's gonna fall off .
 Okay . Yep , yep .
 Okay .
 Okay . Hello everybody . Um I'm Sarah , the Project Manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . Okay , this is our agenda , um
 Tu tu tu tu
 Hi , good morning .
 we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . Um then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as I can understand .
**********
 Now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . Um , we want it to be original , something that's uh people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . Okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that . Um , conceptual design ,
 what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work .
 'Kay .
**********
 Okay , right . We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , I'll go first , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal . So
 Oops .
 Okay , I'll leave space for everyone else . Um
 What's missing ?
 We're running out of blue .
 Okay . I'm not gonna ask you to guess , I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger .
 Mm .
 And I see them as majestic ,
 Oh sorry .
 Mm-hmm .
 and independent ,
 and
 proud .
 Now , who would like to go next ? 'Kay .
 Yeah , me .
 Cat .
 Where did this come from ?
 Is that your lapel then ? There you go .
 Uh , yep . Thank you . Uh , maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make ?
 A kind of dog ?
 Yep .
 It's actually sitting , so it's sitting , it's not standing . Okay , I see it as one thing it's very supportive .
 It's sitting down .
 Sorry ?
 Uh .
 It's your best friend and your you can talk to a dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . Second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition . dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog . Thank you .
 Mm-hmm .
 Okay , thank you .
 Yeah I'll have a go .
 Okay .
 Sorry .
 Please , please leave me a space at the bottom , I'm little , you can get to the top , with standing on a chair .
 Thanks .
 Alright , okay . Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do , I'll have to have to go for something a bit random .
 Does it look like a dog actually ?
 Okay .
 And also , my drawing skill isn't that great so , yeah .
 Well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is um
 Mm .
 I think it's outstandingly good .
 Okay , now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be because that looks like a beak now , so .
 Yeah , it can be a crocodile , it can be a crocodile . Well it was it was an at first firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican but it can be a crocodile now actually .
 Crocodile ?
 Gonna be a bird .
 Is it gonna be it's gonna be a bird .
 O
 That's lovely .
 Yeah and uh I'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is . Um
 Beauti that's
 uh scary ,
 uh strong ,
 yeah that's about it I think .
 Okay it's fine .
 Okay .
 Um , I'm very impressed with your artistic skills , mine's are dreadful . Oops this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in .
 Uh uh
 Wo
 I hope that clicks in , I'll just I'll hold it on , okay .
 Oops , oh dear , what happened there ?
 Technical help .
 Hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version . Okay , uh
 Hmm .
 Okay .
 Again this is off the top of my head , I was gonna do a big cat too , um .
 Uh
 Oh dear , it doesn't look what like what I want it to be .
 Hmm .
 S
 Uh .
 Uh
 It's not a vampire bat honestly .
 Okay , yeah .
 Uh and somewhere there's a body behind . That's my dreadful that's the worst yet , that's it's meant to be an eagle you can tell it's a flying animal could have been a seagull , I never thought of a seagull . An eagle , um again I'm thinking on my feet goodness . I suppose they're all so independent , I'd put that one down again . Da dum um .
 Okay , some sort of bird .
 A seagu right , not a seagull .
 Ah eagle , right okay .
 Eagle , okay .
 They're good at golf .
 Indepen independent , right , did you say they're good at golf ? Are they ? Oh . Oh right , okay , I'm not good at golf . I'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing .
 Eagle .
 Yeah , no yeah , an eagle .
 And uh , birds of prey aren't they , oh dear , intrepid . I'll put that , intrepid .
 Mm-hmm .
 There we go , hope that pen's gonna be okay .
 That's lovely .
 Whoops .
 Okay .
 That was fun , right .
**********
 Um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all . Any ideas ?
 It's about mm , mm yeah .
 Seventeen .
 One point four or something like that . One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that .
 Yeah , yeah , something like that , so that yeah about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that .
 Yeah .
 D fifteen ? Seventeen . Okay , that's expensive .
 Seventeen Pounds .
 Should we be making notes of this ? We can just refer to this later can't we ? Yeah , okay .
 But
 I think so , I think so , I'll be able to um pull it up , or I could put it in the shared folder or something .
 Okay .
 Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway . So , it'd still be yeah , we had to buy one .
 Right .
 Really ?
 So
 Mm .
 so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ?
 I think
 Yeah , um production cost's at twelve fifty , so
 Hmm .
 Okay , pretty huge margin .
 half of the selling price is taken up by building it . Um , and profit aim is fifty million Euros , which is uh
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Mm-hmm .
 In our first year ?
 Yi yes , um yeah , I presume so . Um
 Mm-hmm .
 So then
 You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone user-friendly to everyone . Okay .
 Mm-hmm .
 No , yeah .
 Big target group .
 So yes , yes , I don't think we have to I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point , just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that . Okay .
 No .
 Mm .
**********
 What are your experiences with remote controls ? I mean I've got we got um we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it , but that was quite good , the fact that you could
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Alright .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , that c
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah uh .
 Use all the ones at the same time .
 You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you .
 Right .
 Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like
 Yeah , 'cause you
 Mm-hmm . My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well .
 Okay .
 Mm .
 Yeah , the main that's the main stuff anyway , I mean and you don't want to I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 Mm . And symbols that you don't necessarily understand , symbols you're meant to understand that you don't .
 Yeah .
 Um .
 So simplification of symbols you could think of .
 When they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it . 'Cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , it's obvious what you're doing , um .
 Oh yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm .
 Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you've got a little L_C_D_ display .
 Mm-hmm .
 Menu , alright .
 Yeah .
 Uh uh
 Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus . And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .
 With menus , yeah , yeah .
 Yeah .
 What about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ?
 You mean to save it lesser number .
 Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?
 Right .
 I don't think they tape things , I don't think they use
 Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so .
 Right .
 Right .
 So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , and that's another issue how we tackle that .
 Yeah .
 Mm , yeah , the age gap .
 Yeah , what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out
 what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .
 Mm .
 Mm-hmm .
 I don't know , I d I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system .
 But I don't know how
 Oh yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but
 Right .
 that's just me .
 Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ? Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing .
 Okay .
 Teletext has got that option as well .
 Yeah .
 Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm , okay .
 I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about
 S
 Y
 It might it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small . But it might have its cost implications .
 Yeah ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Yes , no that's important .
 Yeah , like smaller .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ? Something that's easily moulded and produced . Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys .
 Mm .
 Right .
 Yeah .
 No uh uh
**********
 Um , right , okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . Um
 I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation .
 Yeah .
**********
 Just just a quick thing about the um about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui I mean you don't you you can still have plastic and it'd look quite good but
 Sure .
 Ah right .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Sure b y yeah .
 But yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know th that was my main point , we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper , I presume it would . Yeah , yeah , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 I would it would probably .
 Right .
 Okay .
 I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about .
**********
 Okay , so let's break it up there .
 'Kay .
 Okay ? So , see you in half an hour .
 Okay .
 Do we go back to our room ? Yep ?
 I think so , yeah .
 Mm , yeah .
