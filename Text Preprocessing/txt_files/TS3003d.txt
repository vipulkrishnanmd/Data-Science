 So
 Hello .
 Good afternoon . Sorry I'm a little late . Got stuck in the traffic .
 No problem .
 Okay . That's possible on uh this time of day . Starts at three o'clock . Uh Uh , let me see . Our fourth and last meeting .
 Yeah .
 There he is .
 Yes .
 Okay this our last meeting . In this meeting we will discuss our final design . And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . And then we're going to close the project today as well . So after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money .
 And this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . Um , in order to do that we have this agenda .
 We'll have the prototype presentation first . Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria . Then we will look at the finance . Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . Because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote .
 But we will see that later . Then we will do the project uh evaluation , and the closing after that . We've got forty minutes . So we will be finished at half past three .
**********
 But first um
 we will do the this is prototype presentation . So , if some yeah if somebody wants step forward .
 Okay .
 Well this is what me and Richard came up with . The default spot for the on-off button . The mute button just below that . Then there's the volume and channel selectors .
 Simple plus-minus button . Uh we thought of a help button . If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen .
 Then there's the zero to one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo .
 So it's rather simple prototype . And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it .
 Okay .
 Um , is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?
 So
 Sure uh just pop in at any time .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Um , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page .
 Uh , that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh So um
 You put it uh you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons . And you But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel .
 Mm-hmm .
 S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down . So
 Okay .
 Okay . Um
 Yeah .
 Okay . Uh but um I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons . But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons .
 Oh yeah ?
 So I'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons .
 I think if you look at
 most controls , they've got more buttons than this . And well the on-off button , it's it's a necessity . You can't drop that one . The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those .
 That's right .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . So we could cancel that one . I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does .
 Yeah yeah .
 Mm .
 Uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh Yeah . But m Yeah . We disc discuss that already . But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option . So uh they just put in uh put press uh the button and uh
 Long time . Yeah . If you put
 Yeah . Okay .
 Well , you can't
 leave out the number buttons I guess .
 And uh
 Yeah . Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary . Okay .
 And
 Yeah . So it's rather basic already .
 Oh .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Think so . That's what I pointed out earlier . If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 Okay . So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ?
 Yeah , they're It's rather hard to draw on the white-board . But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff . Just for recognition .
 Yeah . Yeah , it
 Just n normal plain buttons .
 Yeah yeah . Just to recognise it , so uh
 Yeah . 'Kay .
 Uh yeah and now we don't need uh LEDs or um
 No .
 Y uh s some uh remote controls uh do it also , but um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it . Uh so
 No .
 Yeah . Okay .
 So and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case . So they jump out .
 Nay .
 Yep .
**********
 Okay . That's nice . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . And I can tell you
 And uh that's about it .
 that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros .
 Mm .
 If we see I don't know if I've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see uh something wrong .
 I counted two batteries . But maybe we can also use one . I don't know if it's possible .
 Since it rechargeable .
 It's rechargeable . That's right .
 Yeah we can u just uh
 Okay . That's two Euros off . We need the advanced chip . So there's not much to uh
 'Kay .
 Yep .
 to save there . Here we have the single curves . Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um ,
 Mm .
 I don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . I think we have to keep that .
 Yeah .
 Yes .
 Yeah .
 Then we have the case material supplements . It's plastic . It's the cheapest one we need . So that's uh not much to save either . But then the biggest costs are the buttons .
 So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low . Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um ,
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 so if we Let's fir first count the buttons we have now . Because I Sixteen . Nah , that will be even more then . Eighteen Euros .
 Uh
 Sixteen , I believe so .
 So ,
 Uh seventeen .
 seventeen .
 Um
 Uh with the help button .
 Okay , including the help ? Yeah . Uh seventeen . I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button
 Yep .
 Damn .
 Yeah .
 uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number
 .
 Yep .
 long . That saves us uh one Euro already . 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think ?
 Yeah .
 Wouldn't Yeah . No . That wouldn't be an option .
 Fifteen buttons .
 And this is
 Uh , d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ?
 No those are one , I think .
 Yeah .
 Well , think actually there're two buttons , aren't they ?
 Where did uh
 Uh , it's just one button . But , um
 Yeah . There were uh two uh for one big button . But they are uh more expensive than the small ones . Uh , yeah . So
 Yeah but th it's not stated in this files . So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing
 It's just a .
 Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .
 That's possibility as well .
 That would cut the cost .
 So And it's good for the design as well . So you can make
 Uh let's see . If you make this
 Looks a bit like uh
 a cross .
 Plus . Min .
 But I don't don't know if if it's cheaper . So uh , we've still got four buttons , but just um So
 Uh s yeah channel . Yeah w
 Yeah th I think they count uh the materials .
 You got uh not not a butt button itself , but uh on the um
 Yeah on the chip there . Yeah .
 Yeah . On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons . So
 Yeah .
 Mm-hmm .
 That's right . That's right .
 Yeah .
 But I think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button . But No but I think
 Yeah , but
 But , I think this really is four buttons anyhow .
 Yes .
 Yeah . Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use . I think they uh try t
 Yes .
 Uh that's that's a big cost .
 If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .
 That's right , but what's the big advantage of our remote then ?
 Only the docking station , I guess .
 Yeah .
 Which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic .
 No . That's extra . That's extra . That's right .
 So it's not even taken into the price .
 Maybe we should to a different supplier .
 That's an option . Poland . Something . Polish supplier . Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th uh these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well .
 Yeah .
 We we could save money on it . But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?
 .
 Yeah , that's what I'm wondering .
 My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message .
 So
 Yeah . That's a point .
 Um
 Are we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it ? So um
 Yeah .
 We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or Can't uh go um
 Yep .
 Yeah .
 No .
 Well , since the market research
 indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . Especially since we have those nice features .
 Nay .
 Yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros . We don't have any more budget to develop it . Yeah . So
 The margin will get too small . Yeah .
 Is it impossible to
 But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty .
 I don't think so .
 It is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons .
 It would be a be a pretty rigid one .
 S
 Yeah .
 Say Or you can take the single chip .
 Ten .
 But , you can't use uh
 There it is .
 Yeah .
 But we want to make a
 uh so uh uh fancy and a good uh Yeah .
 But then w
 Good looking .
 Uh , wi with n Oh , with uh
 Yeah .
 attractive uh o options . So uh , you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty . So
 I think it's uh difficult as well , but
 Or b
 Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control .
 No remote .
 Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers .
 Scroll-wheel's one .
 That's
 Then w
 Because then we save ten buttons . Then we have five and one . And and see . If we have this one and we've got the advanced
 No , it
 Yeah .
 W uh , we're getting close .
 We're getting closer .
 Yeah .
 But how does scroll-wheel work here ?
 Then you will
 Or maybe you can
 um scroll . If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . Until you've got the right number , then you push it .
 Yeah .
 That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also .
 Alright . It's gotta scroll and push . Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well .
 Integrated scroll-wheel push-button . But Yeah .
 Mm .
 You could just not scroll for a half a second .
 Yeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel .
 So you won't need a button .
 I think that would be like the end of our usability .
 But it would definitely crop cost , a lot . And we need the battery .
 D yeah .
 Yeah , but
 And the regular chip is not possible ? It has to be advanced ?
 If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes .
 It has to be advanced . Yeah . Okay . And we can save a Euro by a flat design .
 Hmm .
 That's an option we can Then we're almost there .
 Yep .
 Ja ja .
 Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button .
 Yeah . So if we
 Yeah , or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button .
 Yeah .
 Yeah but I think that's That is a big advantage , if we're
 So Yeah
 Yeah it's a big advantage . But um , it's
 But
 Can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?
 I think so . Yeah .
 Uh , yeah .
 Well , think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , and teletext disappears . But the subtitles stay there .
 If you push it three times ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 But if you push the teletext button twice
 I think that's the case on most
 What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight .
 It's uh
 One m uh one b uh , a few buttons .
 Ah that's not really that
 Well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .
 Yeah . Okay .
 But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is .
 No .
 Yeah .
 Holding a
 No .
 remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero .
 With only five buttons on it .
 And a scroll-wheel .
 I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel .
 If you just make it real simple .
 Because it saves it saves a lot of money . And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .
 True . True .
 Hmm .
 And it's good for the innovative design as well .
**********
 If you would erase these .
 Mm eraser ?
 And we put uh
 Looks a bit odd maybe .
 That's a pretty big scroll wheel .
 That is
 Something like that . Then , yeah . We've got the scroll-wheel . One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one .
 And these are two buttons then .
 We could make two buttons out of that . And just um
 If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel .
 Yeah .
 So that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel .
 Yeah .
 That's really a good good idea , I think .
 And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed .
 More obvious .
 So we make one for the volume , one for the channel .
 Plus scroll . That's right . So we've got one , two , three . Yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want .
 So if we
 Yeah . So
 Yeah .
 That's m that's better .
 So this is five buttons .
 If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . And make it smaller overall .
 So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button
 Y yeah .
 Mm yeah .
 Uh yeah , and then you can
 you get a a much smaller remote .
 Uh yeah .
 That's right .
 And it
 So we can
 sh
 decrease this one to four buttons .
 Yeah ?
 Right now we have five .
 But uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one . Just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . It uh it's a bit uh
 Yeah . That's no problem .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think . Single curved is really easy to just fill in . And cases come right out of the machine . And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one .
 Mm .
 .
 I think this is a really easy one . Um ,
 what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? Freek , what do you think ?
 Well , I still think we should go for the single curve design . But then again ,
 Yeah .
 .
 Richard's argument was very good . Yeah .
 all these changes are not really okay with me . But since
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 We have to cut costs . Yeah . Yeah I'm ag
 we just have to .
 Yeah .
 I'd rather just go to the board and
 Ask for more money .
 get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . I am agreeing with the usability . Yeah .
 Or do some market research and see what the options are .
 Yeah . But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more . So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . It will be necessary to have good help function , as well .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 Yeah .
 So this is scroll .
 I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . Before we went on to the to the whole design .
 Yes . Definitely .
 The th
 But
 I'm glad we could make a bit .
 Yeah .
 It's pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one .
 It's pretty different .
 But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . This will really require a lot of marketing
 No .
 Yeah . It will .
 to get this to sell .
 Yeah .
 But um
 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . This is not familiar for them .
 No , but I think
 So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them .
 I think the most
 But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios . Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels . So maybe it's uh
 Yeah .
 That's right . We can let l We can stick it out , a bit . Like a old old buttons . Maybe that's recognisable for them as well . Yeah . That's a good one .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 So , I'm afraid we have to move on . And it's uh it's b uh less frightening , I think . If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh But we will see .
 Yeah .
 That's true . Might uh might be confusing too .
 Yeah . That's definitely right .
 They'd be like , what ? Only five buttons ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 But very special , so uh
 I would buy it .
 Yeah . But you're not sixty .
 That's right . I would buy it if I was six . No I don't know . What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ? No ?
 Uh , yes they are .
 No .
 No .
**********
 But we can go on with the project evaluation .
 Mm-hmm .
 Let's see . I can sit down I think . We still have fifteen minutes left , so we're nice on schedule .
 Yeah .
 Um , the project process .
 So um , I like set up all these criteria .
 And evaluation of the
 Evaluation criteria . That's right . That was the the point I forgot .
 thingy .
 I should
**********
 There we are . Evaluation criteria . Go ahead . We've got five minutes I think for those criteria . No we've got fifteen minutes but
 Thank you .
 Five more minutes ?
 Okay .
 Uh yes . What ?
 'Kay so I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier .
 Uh yeah .
 Translated it into criteria , which would be these . Um , is the remote fancy ? The shape , look and feel . Innovative ? What new functions are there ? Uh , easy to use ?
 Uh , learnability is a very important factor here . Uh , is it functional ? Are there not too many functions uh among the functions ? And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? And the cost .
 The target group . Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ? And recognability . If our company is If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ?
 And
 So we're supposed to evaluate it right now .
 Okay .
 Let's see .
 Oh I have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting
 were not here .
 Yeah , that's because my pen failed to upload his data . I tried to but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software .
 Mm .
 Okay .
 Yeah ?
 Interesting .
 So
 Mm . 'Kay .
 Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ?
 I think it's fancy .
 Six .
 Yeah .
 Uh six . Yeah .
 We all go for six ? Good .
 Six .
 Um , is the design innovative ?
 Very . Subtitles , buttons . Yeah . Seven . Yeah . So we've got twenty cents for our docking station , huh ?
 Mm . Sh
 I think so , with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons .
 Yeah .
 Seven ?
 Yeah .
 Should be do-able . Is the design easy to use ?
 Yeah . That's right .
 Mm . Not really .
 That's a bit dodgy .
 Well
 Would be for us . But
 For old people I I
 I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five .
 Four or five . Yes .
 W Yeah . Four .
 I'd go for four , too .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Is it functional ?
 Is the design functional ? Um , do we have all functions that we want to include ?
 Yes .
 N Yeah .
 I think we do . Do we have too many functions ? I don't think so . It's pretty slim .
 No .
 No .
 No .
 Think it's uh seven .
 Seven .
 Oh , and do we um
 take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and
 Mm m
 R_S_I_ influences ? Think we do .
 Mm , we haven't thought of that one .
 It was . I had them worked out .
 Mm . They are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost .
 Are the production costs within the preset limits ? Well they are now .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Does the design fit the group of focus ?
 I think that's a three .
 Mm , th yeah .
 Yeah . I think it doesn't .
 No I think with our new radio button , I think it's uh
 Yeah .
 Uh
 I think it's better .
 We have to test it s But
 I don't know .
 I still I think it's too m too fancy . Too too flashy .
 I think
 I think it
 I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control .
 Uh , yeah , true .
 Yeah .
 I would give it a four .
 I'm not sure . I think I'd go for two .
 I go for three . So
 Then we have to do the three . It's the
 'Kay .
 Is the company company recognisable ? Well , we have the logo there .
 Yes it is . Yeah .
 Yeah yeah .
 So
 And they wanna put fashion in their products . Uh in the slogan of the company . And we have the removable front cases . So , I think it's very recognisable . Yep .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 So that will be this .
 I was also supposed to calculate the score , but
 thought we would have another private thingy after this .
 We've got a calculate it .
 Mm ?
 Twendag sieven an twendag .
 Is this Like after this , are we done ? Or
 N We've gonna We're going to evaluate it .
 We're gonna go to our other room again .
 Well , anyhow . These are seven factors times seven is forty
 something . Two ?
 No . Nine ?
 Forty nine .
 Uh , minus one .
 Minus three , minus four .
 Minus four .
 So that would be minus eight .
 Forty one out of forty nine .
 Forty one .
 That's
 Around eighty percent . What is it ?
 Okay .
 Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here .
 That's eighty four percent .
 I think that's a pretty nice score .
 Hmm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Hmm . 'Kay . So that will be the evaluation .
 Okay . Thank you .
**********
 So ,
 that brings us to the project evaluation .
 Yep .
 Thank you . Project process . Did we move through the right phases , you think ? Along the process ?
 Yes .
 Yeah . But it
 Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier .
 Yeah .
 That's right .
 In the design phase .
 So lack of information about prices .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . That's true .
 Yeah .
 Definitely .
 Okay .
 Uh
 Okay . Satisfaction . Was there room for creativity ?
 No .
 No ? It's because of the finance sheet . Yeah .
 Not too much . No .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance uh
 Yeah , true . But
 The room was Yeah .
 Yeah .
 And I would've liked to go for the
 younger users also .
 .
 And just to be able to access internet and
 get something of your own .
 Mm .
 Restrictions .
 Internet access .
 'Kay . Leadership . Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions ?
 Yes .
 Yeah ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Teamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also , you two of you with the uh last phase ?
 So
 Yes , was okay .
 Yeah .
 Nice .
 The tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it's very easy .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 tasks .
 Okay .
 Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do ? Or were they too much ?
 Well , the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but
 Mm .
 Smart-board .
 The digital the digital pen is very nice .
 Yeah .
 If it wants to download its uh data .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 But
 Yes . Yeah .
 Uh
 Failed download .
 Smart-board was irritating .
 So you rather wanted to have a flip-over ? Or something else ?
 A flip-over or a more precise uh
 Yeah . A flipper's uh easier , so
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Faster as well , I think . Yeah .
 digit Yes .
 Flip-over .
 But if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation , it's easier to uh share it with uh other people . Uh so uh you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet , or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory . So
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I tried to open the file on my laptop , but
 So Yeah ? No ?
 No . Didn't work .
 not possible .
 Uh you need a smart board uh application I think .
 Yeah .
 T can uh can you export it uh like a Yeah .
 But I think you can Yeah . Should be possible . Yeah you can export it as image .
 no .
 Must Yeah must be
 Should've done that then .
 So the sharing of the information was uh was okay ?
 .
 Pen is here .
 Yes .
 Uh , network . Yeah , pen is here on the table .
 Uh .
 Uh , yeah .
 So you can Uh
 Yeah . It's possible .
 Mm . Yeah .
 It's possible .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 That's nice . Have we found new ideas for
 having this kind of meetings ? Or
 Um , yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh
 Uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev Um it's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer . Uh , so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 So
 Yeah . So everybody puts his own score . And then it mediates the score , and you can get one Yeah . That's better . So that's uh
 So
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 How do we call ?
 Evaluation
 criteria .
**********
 Okay .
 Mm , any more ideas ? Or questions about the project ? Or about the product ?
 Mm .
 Because I think
 then that we get to our last sheet .
 Are the costs within the budget ?
 Mm yeah .
 Yeah .
 They are .
 Considering we are not going to make a docking station .
 Do we
 Docking station . That's a good point . But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ?
 .
 Yeah .
 Uh and I think you can compensate that as well .
 Perhaps .
 Mm .
 So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem , because it's very cheap to make as well .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? Or what was it ? Fifteen fifteen million . I think we will . If we gonna export this product . It's innovative . Especially in America . People are pretty decadent .
 Fifty grand .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . Mm .
 Sometimes .
**********
 Yeah , still I think I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway
 Yeah .
 it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . So maybe we should just re-focus .
 You can do more .
 Yeah .
 Ah .
 Just put it on the market for everybody . You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers . That's one thing you can change it with . So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market . Just as a test . See how it works . That's I think a good advantage .
 Or specifically for younger people .
 Ah .
 Ah .
 That's true .
 Yeah , I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is , than would be with
 older people .
 Yeah .
 Even if it were their covers .
 Hmm .
**********
 Uh , uh then I think we can have our little celebration , right now .
 But
 Party party .
 That's it . Yeah . I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . I think . I don't know . I didn't get a message
 Where's the champagne ?
 'Kay .
 from the from ending of the Oh I think I have one now . Five more minutes ? Oh that's nice .
 Uh , I believe y uh
