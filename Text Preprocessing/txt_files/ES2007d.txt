 It's Play-Doh .
 Play-Doh's edible . Did you know that ? It's definitely
 Because kids yeah .
 I used to eat it .
 I've , I've definitely eaten it before . I didn't know was edible . .
 Yeah .
 But um , it's it's made edible 'cause , yeah .
 It's it's chew proof .
 It's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then
 Yeah .
 Well , normal babies .
 Actually that makes sense , because I remember like , peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough .
 Yeah .
 Oh yeah it is , yeah . Oh yeah .
**********
 Right . Everybody everybody ready ? Okay , let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah .
 Yep .
 We've got some .
**********
 We've got a cool prototype .
 Yeah , it's pretty exciting . So ,
 everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , yeah , double curved , um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different uh , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here .
 Double curved .
 Nice .
 That is cool .
 So , basically ,
 if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , the thumb button is the power button .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down .
 What's the big blue thing ?
 That's the lock button , has a L_ L_ on it and then the M_ is a mute button . And then it also has digit
 Oh cool .
 what button ? Um . Oh mute .
 And mute .
 For muting the uh
 Um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different .
 Okay .
 That certainly does .
 So all the , I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them . So you don't you
 Mm .
 Which is ant anti-R_S_I_ .
 Yeah . It should be . And it's also conformable to the size of your hand . I mean if that's too big , it's a rubber remote , so you can , you know
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 'S great .
 change that . So d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it
 Oh it's so cute .
 I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one .
 Ah , that's good thinking , yeah .
 Oh right , yeah .
 But , that's I don't see why that's not possible .
 Yeah , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes .
 Yeah . They make left-handed scissors , you know .
 Yeah , I didn't I didn't think about that , but I'd yeah , .
 Yeah , but then
 but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ?
 Yes s
 Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse .
 Mm . Sure . Sure .
 Yeah , I'm sure they'll be able to
 Uh-huh .
 I mean it's only pressing buttons , you don't have to do anything , you know , extraordinary . I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so
 Yeah .
 Imagine d are you right handed ?
 Yeah .
 Imagine you're doing it with your left hand , I don't think it's too
 Yeah , it's not
 But we can have both uh
 Yeah .
 Have them in stock .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Make 'em more appealing as well .
 But um other than that , I mean uh and that's um , you know , that's just something , I think I think it's great , yeah , great idea .
 Do you think it says R_R_ ?
 I think it does .
 I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable .
 Fashion to electronics . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue .
 Plus red , which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh .
 Yeah .
 .
 Yeah .
 There you go .
 So that's that's our end of things wha uh
 That's
 Yeah , very good , yeah . It's come up with what we've you know , the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing , hasn't it , all seems to be there . Well done .
 Yeah .
 And all the playing around is uh
**********
 Um before we move on
 Yeah , I'm just do you wanna plug in ? Okay .
 I need that cable . Thank you . Yeah . Um .
 One thing I do need to do we need to look at , is the costs .
 The costs , was that what you said ?
 Play-Doh is very cheap .
 Well , yeah .
 Mm .
 um
 Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like , oops , it's gone .
 But it's edible .
 Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
 Chew proof .
 Well , they'll buy more of them if you eat them , .
 That was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof .
 Yeah .
 Uh right .
**********
 Okay , now I think we'll do this I could do you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power .
 Yeah .
 Oh ho-ho .
 Yep .
 And the electronics , we decided on it being just a simple , the easiest
 thing that's inside it . Ooh . So the case , we've gone for the double curved .
 Um
 and it's made out of rubber .
 The interface is push-buttons .
 And button supplements well they're in diff special colours , aren't they ? So special colours .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 It's better for
 Special form , yeah , they're a special form there in shapes and stuff .
 Yeah , I mean , these these ones on the side are curved kind of , so
 And special material .
 Yep . Yeah . Um .
 Are they made out of any special material ? No they're not . They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple
 Rubber .
 Well they're rubber , aren't they ?
 The buttons are rubber .
 Okay . Right . So let's see if that comes within budget . And it does . That is gonna cost uh Yeah . That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . So ,
 Yeah .
 .
 We're under budget .
 That's cool .
 Yeah . Yeah .
 And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected .
 this is all very very good . The bosses will be very pleased .
 Okay , let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you . Uh .
 Save it in save it in the uh my documents .
 It's already saved , I think .
 Splendid . Okay .
**********
 So uh , that's done with this with this um doodah , so you're . Gonna do what you were gonna do ,
 Thank you .
 Mm .
 your evaluation .
 Oh , yeah . This is where we all get to I get to write on the , oops , on the board . Right . Oh .
 'S function
 F_ eight .
 Okay .
 I love the smell of that Play-Doh .
 Yeah , have some have some .
 Mm .
 I cou .
**********
 Okay . So , evaluation . We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria . I've got the criterias . And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , one being true , so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria , and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria . And the criterias are , and I'll draw this up on the board so we have a box
 .
 And this is false , this is just like
 to keep you informed . So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle . So the first criteria . Do you all get what we're doing ? Okay , cool . Okay , first criteria , look and feel . So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? As it is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? So what mark should we give for that ?
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm-hmm .
 Mm .
 I would give it a seven .
 Yeah .
 As in it's not .
 Oh , sorry , one .
 Oh sorry , one , d yeah .
 A one .
 A one a one . So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one . Second criteria , new technology . Have we implemented new technology ? As in the new high-tech
 Well , the kinetic thing , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new .
 .
 So it's .
 So we'll give it a
 Well so the um
 It's ergonomic , but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , but that's not a technological thing , that's another thing , i that's another marketing thing . So on the technical side of it it
 Yeah . Yeah . True .
 Yeah .
 I'd say it's about a a twoish ? Two . Three .
 It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , maybe , yeah , I dunno .
 Two .
 Yeah .
 Maybe three , yeah .
 three .
 So criteria three is is it easy to use ? I think it's a one , I think .
 Easy to use . I'd say it's I wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not .
 Yeah .
 I would give it a I would give it a two , 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but
 Mm .
 Two , so it's
 Okay .
 But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ?
 Mm .
 If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Give it a t give it a two .
 Yeah , okay . 'Kay , criteria four is costs . 's great .
 Cost . It's come in under budget . So that's a definite one .
 Yeah . That was great .
 Yeah .
 Amount of buttons .
 Like the amount of buttons , 'cause people like a lot le like
 Contains only the necessary buttons . Yeah .
 So it's a one ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Um criteria six . R_S_I_ is it good against ? Yes . Very good . It's one . And criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ? Is it easy to get lost ?
 Yes s yeah .
 So it's anti-R_S_I_ .
 It's yellow .
 It is very bright , yeah .
 I don't think it's gonna get lost easily .
 No ? But it is smallish .
 It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know .
 Two .
 Maybe it will . Uh .
 T
 Mm . I think i it would , could be , could get lost .
 You think it could lost
 two .
 Mm . Yeah . I mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say I mean , it's not a one , definitely .
 Mm .
 I mean it
 No , I mean
 I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but
 Okay .
 Yeah , anything , I mean . Okay . It's bigger than the average mobile , I guess .
 Yeah .
 But , yeah , it can get lost .
 The mobiles get lost all the time .
 Yeah . Okay , yeah , two is fine .
 But then you ring 'em and you find them . So
 Mm . Mm .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Okay .
 Yeah . So , that's that .
 So that's the evaluation , so I'd say
 Yay .
 We've , we've done well .
 Alright it's all all systems go .
 It's like like a number one . Um .
 Yeah .
 Number one product .
 Mm .
 We can't fail .
 All done , thanks .
 We fitted all the criterias . Yeah .
 .
 Yeah , so
 Well done , Reissa .
 So that's that one .
**********
 Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , you know , both individually and as a team . You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , psp , you know , especially you two . That's all , you know , gone very very well and and and be you know , has been good communication going on .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion , but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and
 Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about ?
 just just
 We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and
 Well .
 You know
 Fantastic .
 Now you guys have been a a great team . Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams , .
 It is .
 been cool .
 I think So I I , you know , and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design .
 In four diff in in four meetings . Funny , all designer meetings could be this quick .
 Yeah .
 You know , maybe this isn't a simulation , maybe this is actually so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just , yeah , they get
 Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote .
 They're using our ideas .
 Yeah . Yeah , two years' time this will be on the market . Ex exactly that product um thum we'll go , yeah , we designed that and no-one will believe us . But um
 So at this stage , I mean , is this the last meeting of the project ? We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something ?
 Yeah .
 No , I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in . Or six , uh
 Y
 Oh really ?
 Just start summarising now .
 You can reply to the same message .
 I haven't got message .
 See summary , there . If you just reply to that one .
 So there's no way to like predict what our 'Cause we had a we originally had a
 As far as our financial uh um goals , we had a specific number for profits that we wanted . It was fifty mil fifty million
 Was it was it fifty or five ?
 I don't remember . But there's not a way to compute that , I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ?
 It gets handed over to another department . What our what our project was was to come up with the product , basically . the for the and just basically is it it come can is it within budget . When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , you know , the b the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the oh yeah , the all the guys in the profit sharing , yeah . Um .
 Depends how much we sell .
 Uh .
 Hmm .
 But we have a vested interest prof profit sharing .
 Yeah , that's it . You know , we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product , we've ma we've got the prototype , it's within budget , it's does everything that we wanted it to do . It's new , it's it's um
 We finished an hour earlier .
 something that uh that isn't out there already .
 I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know . We're not we're not you know , tying tying our cart to that one horse .
 Mm .
 Yeah . Well , this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that , it's that it's um , hang on , I wrote it down here somewhere
 Mm .
 Definitely .
 Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off . Um that , you know , it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , you know , so that's something that's new , which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new .
 Mm .
 Mm .
 Mm .
 It make watching T_V_ healthy .
 Yeah , and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_ , you can f throw it about , you know . It's fine , it's kid proof .
 Yeah .
 Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them .
 Uh .
 Well , you can break the ornaments , but you won't break that . Yeah . So all in all , I think we've done very well . Well done everybody .
 No .
 Mm yep .
 Yay .
 Right , you too .
 Um . Drinks are on the company .
 Cool .
 In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to . Yeah .
 Mm .
 Glad to hear that .
 That's it . Well , as far as I t as far as I know . Um .
 That's it .
 Yep .
 We haven't got the five minute left thing yet .
 No . Anyone wanna play I spy ?
 Mm mm .
 I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of
 silence .
 Should we call the day then ?
 Yeah , I guess . I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire .
 Uh , right .
 Um .
 It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before .
 Mm-hmm .
 In project .
 But I'm not the authority to say that it is .
 Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ?
 I love it . I love it . I think it's cool . Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool .
 Being watched . Um
 Your moment to shine .
 Wow .
 Yeah .
 I thi you know , I'd I'd n yeah , as we said earlier , I've not never seen that before . something that t the whiteboard
 Yeah .
 thingy , that's great .
 Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing . I mean it's i or in such a new idea . It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Right , I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step .
 Yeah . Yeah . Mm .
 Logitech .
**********
 I guess we should end this , since we're off off topic .
 Yeah .
 So . Shall we
 Meeting adjourned .
 Right .
 Yeah .
