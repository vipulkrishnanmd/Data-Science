 Very nice .
 I haven't looked at it , but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens .
 If you're all ready .
 Yeah .
 So is the agenda ? Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing .
**********
 Project aim is a new remote control . It's original , uh trendy and it's user-friendly . Project method , functional design , individual work , another meeting , conceptual design , individual work , and a meeting of details design , individual work and a meeting .
 'Kay .
**********
 Tool training .
 Try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal .
 Okay .
 Um .
 Uh Miss Industrial Designer , would you like to go first ?
 Okay .
 So are we supposed to bring the little things for the
 Yeah , why don't you just c , I think just clip on clip do you have a belt ?
 Clip .
 Mm .
 Or put 'em in your pocket , yeah .

 It's an elephant .
 That's a very good elephant .
 The back end of an elephant .
 Oh my gosh , I'm never gonna be able to draw that well .
 'Kay , and you want to write up on there , it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal .
 Um okay , it's big , it's got a great memory .
 Does it ? Oh .
 Supposed to have a great memory , we say an elephant never forgets . And uh dunno know why but looks like nice to me . Nice animal .
 Mm .
 Mm .
 Okay . Wonderful , well done . Do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off ?
 Okay .
 And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ?
 Aesthetic yep , sure .
 I have no idea what my favourite animal is .
 'Kay , my favourite animal , uh let's see .
 Oh .
 It's
 Dunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before . It's a liger , a combination of a lion and tiger . Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite ? Oh it's a hilarious movie . You have to see it . And
 No .
 A what ?
 Alright .
 How .
 No .
 No .
 No .
 and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much
 the awesomest
 animal .
 But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it .
 Okay , well done .
 Great .
 Me ?
 Yeah . Miss mar Miss Marketing ?
 Okay .
 Not quite sure how this is gonna work .
 There go .
 Cool . Uh well I'll try my best to draw .
 Can I just draw the face ?
 Um yeah , I think you can just draw the face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks .
 Ooh .
 It's a cat . Which also has what ? A big fat body and
 That's a very pr pretty cat .
 big and a long tail .
 Okay , do y do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it ?
 Why ? Because um cuddly .
 And usually cats are very friendly . Usually .
 And they're healing as well . They heal . And they can feel when a human's got problems so
 Wow , so they're kinda spiritual .
 So , that's why I like cats .
 Well done .
 There we are , that's me .
 Okay .
 Mm .
 Um , I don't actually have a favourite animal , but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh .
 I honestly can't draw for toffee . Uh .
 Really ? Oh that's a
 Yeah .
 no no uh
 A prairie dog ? Oh a squirrel ?
 That's exactly what it is . Uh not a very good one
 Not bad I would say .
 Yeah , that's pretty good .
 Okay , well , you got it's a s
 It's a squirrel , and I like them , because they're cute
 and stupid .
 Very good .
 Ah .
 Alright .
 Right .
**********
 Okay , so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working .
 Mm . Let's move on to the next page .
**********
 Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros .
 Market range internationally sold .
 Yeah . Production cost , ah right it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make .
 Ah right okay .
**********
 experience with with remote control , so talk about who who's used what . Any ideas ?
 Stuff like that .
 Next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
 At quarter to twelve .
 So I think before we close uh , we are expected I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our
 what our ideas where . I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide . Uh
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 S
 Yeah , I think we're I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for
 Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or oh okay . I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would
 roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe .
**********
 Okay . Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ?
 Pretty much everybody .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I think we've all got
 Uh .
 Um .
 Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ?
 Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control .
 Okay .
 'Kay um .
 Well .
 T
 A new remote control for T_V_ .
 What would I like ? Um .
 W what
 You want it big do you want it small .
 Medium .
 Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and
 Mm .
 Yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas , I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something .
 Video and ts hi-fi and stuff .
 Maybe you yeah now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices ,
 Mm .
 but that would p that would probably be quite expensive .
 But how do we know how much uh , I mean , how much do we have per how much ? Twelve fifty .
 Twelve fifty .
 It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit .
 Each .
 Per unit , yeah .
 Cost .
 So do we have to be realistic within the budget or
 Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . Yeah .
 Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not . So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things .
 Guess
 Right .
 Yeah .
 Um .
 Couldn't we have like one that comes out ?
 Like so you have one in like mm it doesn't have to be really thick . I mean remote controls can be thin bits . And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out . have slides . And then it all comes compact
 Yeah .
 'Kay .
 Okay , that's .
 into one . So it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically .
 Th that's an idea .
 Yeah .
 So you just flip them out .
 Okay .
 Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , for example . I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated .
 One side for kids , one side for adults .
 I'm not sure if that's like
 Yeah . Or grandma as well , you know it's like what is the mute button .
 I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it .
 No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but
 Oh .
 Oh okay .
 Like it or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 That would be cool . I was thinking that like a flip .
 F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe .
 Mm-hmm .
 Um , oh we've got five minutes left .
 Start breaking up .
 Okay . Um .
 But okay .
 Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there .
 .
 Yeah , we should uh I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate
 Yeah .
 D_V_D_ players , things like that .
 I have got I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 Right .
 What do you reckon ?
 Yeah , I mean .
 See 'cause , I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make .
 Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be um
 I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker .
 have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , uh simple to use , and looks decent and
 Yeah .
 May w you know , maybe even
 But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? I mean if it's if it's just like
 Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people or so people that uh b don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for
 Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people ,
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 certain certain demographic
 Or just one that looks really fucking cool .
 Mm-hmm .
 Yeah , no I think you're right .
 Could be really light or , I dunno , something special .
 Yeah , rathe rather than focus on
 Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should
 Y
 Yeah .
 Yeah , 'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all all the r
 Yeah .
 Yeah . I mean obviously everyone we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's
 Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Yeah , that's right . Yeah . I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but that's not gonna happen .
 I think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and ooh , the telephone's the television switched on or something . So maybe something that like
 does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something .
 Okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , yeah .
 Yeah .
 But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it . So make it Yeah .
 Yeah , it's gotta be sellable . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , that's true what you were saying , I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 And even for kids as well . It's um it's safer for them , I guess . Like they don't flick onto
 channels and all that sl flick onto .
 No porn channel for children .
 Okay . Um alright , so we've got some ideas , we've got um
 Okay .
 I guess that's good good for now .
**********
 Let's move on .
 Mm .
 Oops , let's close that . Next meeting , uh okay .
 W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ?
 Industrial Designer um which is
 Ah ri okay . these are requirement specification .
 That's
 Um .
 And I'm marketing .
 Mm .
 Yeah , there you go . So
 User Interface Designer , that's that's that's you , so you gotta you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um .
 That's me . Okay .
 Right . Right .
 Industrial Designer , you are the one , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um
 whether it's what goes into the box , somehow .
 Mm . Har how it works an
 And in marketing
 These are requirement specification .
 Bu
 User requirements specifications .
 So what the user requires
 Yeah , what
 Do you think our two kind of overlap , because
 in a remote .
 Right , okay , yeah .
 Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap .
 I guess that's what it says .
 You two you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you working together .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that .
 Mm .
**********
 Oh , we've been warned to finish the meeting now . Okay .
 Okay everyone , well done . Good meeting .
 Alright , see you in thirty minutes .
 Yeah .
**********
 So , do we take these off ?
 I don't
